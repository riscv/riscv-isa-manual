== Introduction

This document describes the RISC-V privileged architecture, which covers
all aspects of RISC-V systems beyond the unprivileged ISA, including
privileged instructions as well as additional functionality required for
running operating systems and attaching external devices.

[NOTE]
====
Commentary on our design decisions is formatted as in this paragraph,
and can be skipped if the reader is only interested in the specification
itself.

***
We briefly note that the entire privileged-level design described in
this document could be replaced with an entirely different
privileged-level design without changing the unprivileged ISA, and
possibly without even changing the ABI. In particular, this privileged
specification was designed to run existing popular operating systems,
and so embodies the conventional level-based protection model. Alternate
privileged specifications could embody other more flexible
protection-domain models. For simplicity of expression, the text is
written as if this was the only possible privileged architecture.

=== RISC-V Privileged Software Stack Terminology

This section describes the terminology we use to describe components of
the wide range of possible privileged software stacks for RISC-V.

<<privimps>> shows some of the possible software stacks
that can be supported by the RISC-V architecture. The left-hand side
shows a simple system that supports only a single application running on
an application execution environment (AEE). The application is coded to
run with a particular application binary interface (ABI). The ABI
includes the supported user-level ISA plus a set of ABI calls to
interact with the AEE. The ABI hides details of the AEE from the
application to allow greater flexibility in implementing the AEE. The
same ABI could be implemented natively on multiple different host OSs,
or could be supported by a user-mode emulation environment running on a
machine with a different native ISA.

[NOTE]

Our graphical convention represents abstract interfaces using black
boxes with white text, to separate them from concrete instances of
components implementing the interfaces.

The middle configuration shows a conventional operating system (OS) that
can support multiprogrammed execution of multiple applications. Each
application communicates over an ABI with the OS, which provides the
AEE. Just as applications interface with an AEE via an ABI, RISC-V
operating systems interface with a supervisor execution environment
(SEE) via a supervisor binary interface (SBI). An SBI comprises the
user-level and supervisor-level ISA together with a set of SBI function
calls. Using a single SBI across all SEE implementations allows a single
OS binary image to run on any SEE. The SEE can be a simple boot loader
and BIOS-style IO system in a low-end hardware platform, or a
hypervisor-provided virtual machine in a high-end server, or a thin
translation layer over a host operating system in an architecture
simulation environment.

[NOTE]
====
Most supervisor-level ISA definitions do not separate the SBI from the
execution environment and/or the hardware platform, complicating
virtualization and bring-up of new hardware platforms.
====
The rightmost configuration shows a virtual machine monitor
configuration where multiple multiprogrammed OSs are supported by a
single hypervisor. Each OS communicates via an SBI with the hypervisor,
which provides the SEE. The hypervisor communicates with the hypervisor
execution environment (HEE) using a hypervisor binary interface (HBI),
to isolate the hypervisor from details of the hardware platform.

[NOTE]
====
The ABI, SBI, and HBI are still a work-in-progress, but we are now
prioritizing support for Type-2 hypervisors where the SBI is provided
recursively by an S-mode OS.
====

Hardware implementations of the RISC-V ISA will generally require
additional features beyond the privileged ISA to support the various
execution environments (AEE, SEE, or HEE).

=== Privilege Levels

At any time, a RISC-V hardware thread (_hart_) is running at some
privilege level encoded as a mode in one or more CSRs (control and
status registers). Three RISC-V privilege levels are currently defined
as shown in <<privlevels>>.

Privilege levels are used to provide protection between different
components of the software stack, and attempts to perform operations not
permitted by the current privilege mode will cause an exception to be
raised. These exceptions will normally cause traps into an underlying
execution environment.

[NOTE]
====
In the description, we try to separate the privilege level for which
code is written, from the privilege mode in which it runs, although the
two are often tied. For example, a supervisor-level operating system can
run in supervisor-mode on a system with three privilege modes, but can
also run in user-mode under a classic virtual machine monitor on systems
with two or more privilege modes. In both cases, the same
supervisor-level operating system binary code can be used, coded to a
supervisor-level SBI and hence expecting to be able to use
supervisor-level privileged instructions and CSRs. When running a guest
OS in user mode, all supervisor-level actions will be trapped and
emulated by the SEE running in the higher-privilege level.
====
The machine level has the highest privileges and is the only mandatory
privilege level for a RISC-V hardware platform. Code run in machine-mode
(M-mode) is usually inherently trusted, as it has low-level access to
the machine implementation. M-mode can be used to manage secure
execution environments on RISC-V. User-mode (U-mode) and supervisor-mode
(S-mode) are intended for conventional application and operating system
usage respectively.

Each privilege level has a core set of privileged ISA extensions with
optional extensions and variants. For example, machine-mode supports an
optional standard extension for memory protection. Also, supervisor mode
can be extended to support Type-2 hypervisor execution as described in
<<hypervisor>>.

Implementations might provide anywhere from 1 to 3 privilege modes
trading off reduced isolation for lower implementation cost, as shown in
<<privcombs>>.

All hardware implementations must provide M-mode, as this is the only
mode that has unfettered access to the whole machine. The simplest
RISC-V implementations may provide only M-mode, though this will provide
no protection against incorrect or malicious application code.

[NOTE]
====
The lock feature of the optional PMP facility can provide some limited
protection even with only M-mode implemented.
====
Many RISC-V implementations will also support at least user mode
(U-mode) to protect the rest of the system from application code.
Supervisor mode (S-mode) can be added to provide isolation between a
supervisor-level operating system and the SEE.

A hart normally runs application code in U-mode until some trap (e.g., a
supervisor call or a timer interrupt) forces a switch to a trap handler,
which usually runs in a more privileged mode. The hart will then execute
the trap handler, which will eventually resume execution at or after the
original trapped instruction in U-mode. Traps that increase privilege
level are termed _vertical_ traps, while traps that remain at the same
privilege level are termed _horizontal_ traps. The RISC-V privileged
architecture provides flexible routing of traps to different privilege
layers.

[NOTE]
====
Horizontal traps can be implemented as vertical traps that return
control to a horizontal trap handler in the less-privileged mode.
====

=== Debug Mode

Implementations may also include a debug mode to support off-chip
debugging and/or manufacturing test. Debug mode (D-mode) can be
considered an additional privilege mode, with even more access than
M-mode. The separate debug specification describes operation of
a RISC-V hart in debug mode. Debug mode reserves a few CSR addresses
that are only accessible in D-mode, and may also reserve some portions
of the physical address space on a platform.
