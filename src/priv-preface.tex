This is {\bf a draft of} version 1.10 of the RISC-V privileged
architecture proposal.  Changes from version 1.9.1 include:

\item The previous version of this document was released under a
  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence by the
  original authors, and this and future versions of this document will
  be released under the same licence.
\item The interrupt-enable stack discipline has been simplified.
\item A optional mechanism to change the base ISA used by supervisor
  and user modes has been added, and the field previously called Base
  in {\tt misa} has been renamed to {\tt MXL} for consistency.
\item The supervisor virtual memory configuration has been moved from the
  {\tt mstatus} register to the {\tt sptbr} register.
\item The SFENCE.VM instruction has been removed in favor of the improved
  SFENCE.VMA instruction.
\item Hardware management of page-table entry Accessed and Dirty bits has
  been made optional; simpler implementations may trap to software to
  set them.
\item The counter-enable scheme has changed, so that S-mode can
  control availability of counters to U-mode, respectively.
\item H-mode has been removed, as we are focusing on recursive
  virtualization support in S-mode.  The encoding space has been
  reserved and may be repurposed at a later date.
\item A mechanism to improve virtualization performance by
  trapping S-mode virtual-memory management operations has been added.

\section*{Preface to Version 1.9.1}

This is version 1.9.1 of the RISC-V privileged architecture
proposal.  Changes from version 1.9 include:

\begin{itemize}
  \parskip 0pt
  \itemsep 1pt
\item Numerous additions and improvements to the commentary sections.
\item Change configuration string proposal to be use a search process
  that supports various formats including Device Tree String and
  flattened Device Tree.
\item Made {\tt misa} optionally writable to support modifying base
  and supported ISA extensions.  CSR address of {\tt misa} changed.
\item Added description of debug mode and debug CSRs.
\item Added a hardware performance monitoring scheme.  Simplified the
  handling of existing hardware counters, removing privileged versions
  of the counters and the corresponding delta registers.
\item Fixed description of SPIE in presence of user-level interrupts.
\end{itemize}
