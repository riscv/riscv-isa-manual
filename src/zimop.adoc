== "Zimop" Extension for May-Be-Operations, Version 1.0

This chapter defines the "Zimop" extension, which introduces the concept of
instructions that _may be operations_ (MOPs).  MOPs are initially defined to
simply write zero to `x[rd]`, but are designed to be redefined by later
extensions to perform some other action.
The Zimop extension defines an encoding space for 40 MOPs.

[NOTE]
====
It is sometimes desirable to define instruction-set extensions whose
instructions, rather than raising illegal-instruction exceptions when the extension is
not implemented, take no useful action (beyond writing `x[rd]`).
For example, programs with control-flow integrity checks can
execute correctly on implementations without the corresponding extension,
provided the checks are simply ignored.  Implementing these checks as MOPs
allows the same programs to run on implementations with or without the
corresponding extension.

Although similar in some respects to HINTs, MOPs cannot be encoded as HINTs,
because unlike HINTs, MOPs are allowed to alter architectural state.

Because MOPs may be redefined by later extensions, standard software should
not execute a MOP unless it is deliberately targeting an extension that has
redefined that MOP.
====

The Zimop extension defines 32 MOP instructions named MOP.R.__n__, where
__n__ is an integer between 0 and 31, inclusive.
Unless redefined by another extension, these instructions simply write 0 to
`x[rd]`.  Their encoding allows future extensions to define them to read `x[rs1]`,
as well as write `x[rd]`.

[[mop-r]]

The Zimop extension additionally defines 8 MOP instructions named
MOP.RR.__n__, where __n__ is an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive.
Unless redefined by another extension, these instructions simply
write 0 to `x[rd]`.  Their encoding allows future extensions to define them to
read `x[rs1]` and `x[rs2]`, as well as write `x[rd]`.

[[mop-rr]]

NOTE: The recommended assembly syntax for MOP.R.__n__ is MOP.R.__n__ rd, rs1,
with any `x`-register specifier being valid for either argument.  Similarly for
MOP.RR.__n__, the recommended syntax is MOP.RR.__n__ rd, rs1, rs2.
The extension that redefines a MOP may define an alternate assembly mnemonic.

NOTE: These MOPs are encoded in the SYSTEM major opcode in part because it is
expected their behavior will be modulated by privileged CSR state.

NOTE: These MOPs are defined to write zero to `x[rd]`, rather than performing
no operation, to simplify instruction decoding and to allow testing the
presence of features by branching on the zeroness of the result.

The MOPs defined in the Zimop extension do not carry a syntactic dependency
from `x[rs1]` or `x[rs2]` to `x[rd]`, though an extension that redefines the
MOP may impose such a requirement.

NOTE: Not carrying a syntactic dependency relieves straightforward
implementations of reading `x[rs1]` and `x[rs2]`.

=== "Zcmop" Compressed May-Be-Operations Extension, Version 1.0

This section defines the "Zcmop" extension, which defines eight 16-bit MOP
instructions named C.MOP.__n__, where __n__ is an odd integer between 1 and
15, inclusive.  C.MOP.__n__ is encoded in the reserved encoding space
corresponding to C.LUI x__n__, 0, as shown in <<tab:c-mop>>.
Unlike the MOPs defined in the Zimop extension, the C.MOP.__n__ instructions
are defined to _not_ write any register.
Their encoding allows future extensions to define them to read register
`x[__n__]`.

The Zcmop extension requires the Zca extension.

[[c-mop]]

NOTE: Very few suitable 16-bit encoding spaces exist.  This space was chosen
because it already has unusual behavior with respect to the `rd`/`rs1`
field--it encodes `c.addi16sp` when the field contains `x2`--and is
therefore of lower value for most purposes.

|===
|Mnemonic | Encoding           | Redefinable to read register

|C.MOP.1  | `0110000010000001` | `x1`
|C.MOP.3  | `0110000110000001` | `x3`
|C.MOP.5  | `0110001010000001` | `x5`
|C.MOP.7  | `0110001110000001` | `x7`
|C.MOP.9  | `0110010010000001` | `x9`
|C.MOP.11 | `0110010110000001` | `x11`
|C.MOP.13 | `0110011010000001` | `x13`
|C.MOP.15 | `0110011110000001` | `x15`
|===

NOTE: The recommended assembly syntax for C.MOP.__n__ is simply the nullary
C.MOP.__n__.  The possibly accessed register is implicitly `x__n__`.

NOTE: The expectation is that each Zcmop instruction is equivalent to some
Zimop instruction, but the choice of expansion (if any) is left to the
extension that redefines the MOP.
Note, a Zcmop instruction that does not write a value can expand into a write
to `x0`.
