== Cryptography Extensions: Vector Instructions, Version 1.0

This document describes the Vector Cryptography extensions to the 
RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture.

[[crypto_vector_introduction]]
=== Introduction

This document describes the RISC-V _vector_ cryptography extensions.
All instructions proposed here are based on the Vector registers.
The instructions are designed to be highly performant, with large
application and server-class cores being the main target.
A companion chapter _Volume I: Scalar & Entropy Source Instructions_,
describes
cryptographic instruction proposals for smaller cores which do not
implement the vector extension.

[[crypto_vector_audience]]
==== Intended Audience

Cryptography is a specialized subject, requiring people with many different
backgrounds to cooperate in its secure and efficient implementation.
Where possible, we have written this specification to be understandable by
all, though we recognize that the motivations and references to
algorithms or other specifications and standards may be unfamiliar to those
who are not domain experts.

This specification anticipates being read and acted on by various people
with different backgrounds.
We have tried to capture these backgrounds
here, with a brief explanation of what we expect them to know, and how
it relates to the specification.
We hope this aids people's understanding of which aspects of the specification
are particularly relevant to them, and which they may (safely!) ignore or
pass to a colleague.

Cryptographers and cryptographic software developers::
These are the people we expect to write code using the instructions
in this specification.
They should understand the motivations for the
instructions we include, and be familiar with most of the algorithms
and outside standards to which we refer.

Computer architects::
We do not expect architects to have a cryptography background.
We nonetheless expect architects to be able to examine our instructions
for implementation issues, understand how the instructions will be used
in context, and advise on how best to fit the functionality the
cryptographers want.

Digital design engineers & micro-architects::
These are the people who will implement the specification inside a
core. Again, no cryptography expertise is assumed, but we expect them to
interpret the specification and anticipate any hardware implementation
issues, e.g., where high-frequency design considerations apply, or where
latency/area tradeoffs exist etc.
In particular, they should be aware of the literature around efficiently
implementing AES and SM4 SBoxes in hardware.

Verification engineers::
These people are responsible for ensuring the correct implementation of the
extensions in hardware.
No cryptography background is assumed.
We expect them to identify interesting test cases from the
specification. An understanding of their real-world usage will help with this.

These are by no means the only people concerned with the specification,
but they are the ones we considered most while writing it.

[[crypto_vector_sail_specifications]]
==== Sail Specifications

RISC-V maintains a 
link:https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv[formal model]
of the ISA specification,
implemented in the Sail ISA specification language
cite:[sail].
Note that _Sail_ refers to the specification language itself,
and that there is a _model of RISC-V_, written using Sail.

It was our intention to include actual Sail code in this specification.
However, the Vector Crypto Sail model needs the Vector Sail model as a
basis on which to build. This Vector Cryptography extensions specification
was completed before there was an approved RISC-V Vector Sail Model.
Therefore, we don't have any Sail code to include in the instruction
descriptions. Instead we have included Sail-like pseudocode. While we have
endeavored to adhere to Sail syntax, we have taken some liberties for the
sake of simplicity where we believe that that our intent is clear to the
reader.

[NOTE]
====
Where variables are concatenated, the order shown is how they would appear
in a vector register from left to right.
For example, an element group specified as `{a, b, e, f}` would appear in a vector
register with `a` having the highest element index of the group and `f` having the
lowest index of the group.
====

For the sake of brevity, our pseudocode does not include the handling of
masks or tail elements. We follow the _undisturbed_ and _agnostic_ policies
for masks and tails  as described in the *RISC-V "V" Vector Extension*
specification. Furthermore, the code does not explicitly handle overlap and SEW
constraints; these are, however, explicitly stated in the text.

In many cases the pseudocode includes
calls to supporting functions which are too verbose to include directly
in the specification.
This supporting code is listed in
<<crypto_vector_appx_sail>>.


The 
link:https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/manual.pdf[Sail Manual]
is recommended reading in order to best understand the code snippets.
Also, the
link:https://github.com/billmcspadden-riscv/sail/blob/cookbook_br/cookbook/doc/TheSailCookbook_Complete.pdf[The Sail Programming Language: A Sail Cookbook]
is a good reference that is in the process of being written.

[[crypto_vector_policies]]
==== Policies

In creating this proposal, we tried to adhere to the following
policies:

* Where there is a choice between:
  1) supporting diverse implementation strategies for an algorithm
  or
  2) supporting a single implementation style which is more performant /
     less expensive;
  the vector crypto extensions will pick the more constrained but performant
  option.
  This fits a common pattern in other parts of the RISC-V specifications,
  where recommended (but not required) instruction sequences for performing
  particular tasks are given as an example, such that both hardware and
  software implementers can optimize for only a single use-case.
  
* The extensions will be designed to support _existing_ standardized
  cryptographic constructs well.
  It will not try to support proposed standards, or cryptographic
  constructs which exist only in academia.
  Cryptographic standards which are settled upon concurrently with or after
  the RISC-V vector cryptographic extensions standardization will be dealt with
  by future RISC-V vector cryptographic
  standard extensions.
  
* Historically, there has been some discussion
  cite:[LSYRR:04]
  on how newly supported operations in general-purpose computing might
  enable new bases for cryptographic algorithms.
  The standard will not try to anticipate new useful low-level
  operations which _may_ be useful as building blocks for
  future cryptographic constructs.
  
* Regarding side-channel countermeasures:
  Where relevant, proposed instructions must aim to remove the
  possibility of any timing side-channels. All instructions
  shall be implemented with data-independent timing. That is, the latency of
  the execution of these instructions shall not vary with different input values.

[[crypto-vector-element-groups]]
==== Element Groups

Many vector crypto instructions operate on operands that are wider than elements (which are currently limited
to 64 bits wide).
Typically, these operands are 128- and 256-bits wide. In many cases, these operands are comprised of smaller
operands that are combined (for example, each SHA-2 operand is comprised of 4 words). However, in other cases
these operands are a single value (for example, in the AES round instructions, each operand is 128-bit block
or round key).

We treat these operands as a vector of one or more _element groups_ as defined in <<vector-element-groups>>.

Each vector crypto instruction that operates on element groups explicitly specifies their three defining
parameters: EGW, EGS, and EEW.

| SM3      | <<Zvksh>>            | 256 | 32 | 8
|===

[NOTE]
====
- Element Group Width (`EGW`) - total number of bits in an element group
- Effective Element Width (`EEW`) - number of bits in each element
- Element Group Size (`EGS`) - number of elements in an element group
====

For all of the vector crypto instructions in this specification, `EEW`=`SEW`.

[NOTE]
====
The required `SEW` for each cryptographic instruction was chosen to match what is
typically needed for other instructions when implementing the targeted algorithm. 
====

- A *Vector Element Group* is a vector of one or more element groups.
- A *Scalar Element Group* is a single element group. 

Element groups can be formed across registers in implementations where
`VLEN`< `EGW` by using an `LMUL`>1.

[NOTE]
====
Since the the *vector extension for application processors* requires a minimum of VLEN of 128,
at most such implementations would require LMUL=2 to form the largest element groups in this specification.

However, implementations with a smaller VLEN, such as embedded designs, will requires a larger `LMUL`
to form the necessary element groups.
It is important to keep in mind that this reduces the number of register groups available such
that it may be difficult or impossible to write efficient code for the intended cryptographic algorithms.

For example, an implementation with `VLEN`=32 would need to set `LMUL`=8 to create a
256-bit element group for `SM3`. This would mean that there would only be 4 register groups,
3 of which would be consumed by a single `SM3` message-expansion instruction.
====

As with all vector instructions, the number of elements processed is specified by the
vector length `vl`. The number of element groups operated upon is then `vl`/`EGS`.
Likewise the starting element group is `vstart`/`EGS`.
See <<crypto-vector-instruction-constraints>> for limitations on `vl` and `vstart`
for vector crypto instructions.

// If this ratio is not an integer for a vector crypto instruction, an illegal instruction exception is raised.

// Since `vstart` is expressed in elements, the starting element group is `vstart`/`EGS`. 
// If this ratio is not an integer for a vector crypto instruction, an illegal instruction exception is raised.

[[crypto-vector-instruction-constraints]]
==== Instruction Constraints
The following is a quick reference for the various constraints of specific Vector Crypto instructions.

vl and vstart constraints::
Since `vl` and `vstart` refer to elements, Vector Crypto instructions that use elements groups
(See <<crypto-vector-element-groups>>) require that these values are an integer multiple of the
Element Group Size (`EGS`).

- Instructions that violate the `vl` or `vstart` requirements are _reserved_.

| vaes*   | 4
| vsha2*  | 4
| vg*     | 4
| vsm3*   | 8 
| vsm4*   | 4

|===

LMUL constraints::
For element-group instructions, `LMUL`*`VLEN` must always be at least as large as `EGW`, otherwise an
_illegal instruction exception_ is raised, even if `vl`=0.

[%autowidth]
[%header,cols="4,2,2"]

| vg*     | 32 | 128
| vsm3*   | 32 | 256 
| vsm4*   | 32 | 128

|===


SEW constraints::
Some Vector Crypto instructions are only defined for a specific `SEW`. In such a case
all other `SEW` values are _reserved_.

| vg*            | 32
| vsm3*          | 32
| vsm4*          | 32


|===

Source/Destination overlap constraints::
Some Vector Crypto instructions have overlap constraints. Encodings that violate these constraints are _reserved_.

In the case of the `.vs` instructions defined in this specification, `vs2` holds a 128-bit scalar element group.
For implementations with `VLEN` ≥ 128, `vs2` refers to a single register. Thus, the `vd` register group must not
overlap the `vs2` register.
However, in implementations where `VLEN` < 128, `vs2` refers to a register group comprised of the number
of registers needed to hold the 128-bit scalar element group. In this case, the `vd` register group must not
overlap this `vs2` register group.

| vsm3me        | vs2      | vd
| vsm3c         | vs2      | vd


|===

[[crypto-vector-scalar-instructions]]
==== Vector-Scalar Instructions

The RISC-V Vector Extension defines three encodings for Vector-Scalar operations which get their scalar operand from a GPR or FP register:

- OPIVX: Scalar GPR _x_ register
- OPFVF: Scalar FP _f_ register
- OPMVX: Scalar GPR _x_ register

However, the Vector Extensions include Vector Reduction Operations which can also be considered
Vector-Scalar operations because a scalar operand is provided from element 0 of
vector register `vs1`. The vector operand is provided in vector register group `vs2`.
These reduction operations all use the `.vs` suffix in their mnemonics. Additionally, the reduction operations all produce a scalar result in element 0 of the destination register, `vd`.

The Vector Crypto Extensions define Vector-Scalar instructions that are similar to these
Vector Reduction Operations in that they get a scalar operand from a vector register. However, they differ
in that they get a scalar element group
(see <<crypto-vector-element-groups>>)
// link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/element_groups.adoc[RISC-V Vector Element Groups])
from `vs2` and they return _vector_ results to `vd`, which is also a source vector operand.
These Vector-Scalar crypto instructions also use the `.vs` suffix in their mnemonics.

[NOTE]
====
We chose to use `vs2` as the scalar operand, and `vd` as the vector operand, so that we could use the `vs1`
specifier as additional encoding bits for these instructions. This allows these instructions to have a
much smaller encoding footprint, leaving more rooms for other instructions in the future.
====

These instructions enable a single key, specified as a scalar element group in `vs2`, to be
applied to each element group of register group `vd`.

[NOTE]
====
Scalar element groups will occupy at most a single register in application processors. However, in implementations where
VLEN<128, they will occupy 2 (VLEN=64) or 4 (VLEN=32) registers.
====


[NOTE]
====
It is common for multiple AES encryption rounds (for example) to be performed in parallel with the same
round key (e.g. in counter modes).
Rather than having to first splat the common key across the whole vector group, these vector-scalar
crypto instructions allow the round key to be specified as a scalar element group.
====

// In the case of AES256 all-rounds instructions we need to provide two 128-bit keys; one is held in `vs1` and
// the other is held in `vs2`. The 128-bit data to be processed is held in `vd`.
// A vector-scalar form of this instruction looks different from the existing vector-scalar instructions in that
// both `vs1` and `vs2` are treated as scalar operands that apply to the vector operands of `vd`. 

// [NOTE]
// ====
// Previously, the AES and SM4 instructions that performed rounds operations (including AES all-rounds instructions)
// were defined to be destructive operations where the data source was provided in `vd` and the key was provided in
// `vs2`. With the advent of the new crypto vector-scalar instructions, we are changing these instructions
// to use `vs1` for the key and `vs2` for the data.
// In the case of vector-scalar instructions, the scalar key will be held in
// element group 0 of `vs1` . This is done to remain consistent with the use of `vs1` for the scalar element in
// all of the existing vector-scalar operations as well as the vector reduction operations. 
// ====

[[crypto-vector-software-portability]]
==== Software Portability
The following contains some guidelines that enable the portability of vector-crypto-based code
to implementations with different values for `VLEN`

Application Processors::
Application processors are expected to follow the V-extension and will therefore have `VLEN` ≥ 128.



// [NOTE]
// ====
Since most of the _cryptography-specific_ instructions have an `EGW`=128, nothing special needs to be done
for these instructions to support implementations with `VLEN`=128.

However, the SHA-512 and SM3 instructions have an `EGW`=256. Implementations with `VLEN` = 128, require that
`LMUL` is doubled for these instructions in order to create 256-bit elements across a pair of registers.
Code written with this doubling of `LMUL` will not affect the results returned by implementations with `VLEN` ≥ 256
because `vl` controls how many element groups are processed. Therefore, we recommend that libraries that implement
SHA-512 and SM3 employ this doubling of `LMUL` to ensure that the software can run on all implementation
with `VLEN` ≥ 128.

While the doubling of `LMUL` for these instructions is _safe_ for implementations with `VLEN` ≥ 256, it may be less
optimal as it will result in unnecessary register pressure and might exact a performance penalty in
some microarchitectures. Therefore, we suggest that in addition to providing portable code for SHA-512 and SM3,
libraries should also include more optimal code for these instructions when `VLEN` ≥ 256.
// ====

|===
| Algorithm
| Instructions
| VLEN
| LMUL

| SHA-512 |  vsha2* | 64 | vl/2
| SM3     | vsm3*   | 32 | vl/4 
|===

// [NOTE]
// ====
// We recommend that all library code for application processors be written so that it can be run on any
// implementation with `VLEN` ≥ 128. Such libraries are also encouraged to have versions of code for
// SHA-512 and SM3 optimized for implementations with `VLEN` ≥ 256.
// ====

Embedded Processors::

Embedded processors will typically have implementations with `VLEN` < 128. This will require code to be written with
larger `LMUL` values to enable the element groups to be formed.

The `.vs` instructions require scalar element groups of `EGW`=128. On implementations with `VLEN` < 128, these scalar
element groups will necessarily be formed across registers. This is different from most scalars in vector instructions
that typically consume part of a single register.


// [NOTE]
// ====
We recommend that different code be available for `VLEN`=32 and `VLEN`=64, as code written for `VLEN`=32 will
likely be too burdensome for `VLEN`=64 implementations.
// ====

[[crypto_vector_extensions]]
=== Extensions Overview

The section introduces all of the  extensions in the Vector Cryptography
Instruction Set Extension Specification.

The <<zvknh,Zvknhb>> and <<zvbc>> Vector Crypto Extensions
--and accordingly the composite extensions <<Zvkn>> and <<Zvks>>--
require a Zve64x base,
or application ("V") base Vector Extension.

All of the other Vector Crypto Extensions can be built
on _any_ embedded (Zve*) or application ("V") base Vector Extension.

// See <<crypto-vector-element-groups>> for more details on vector element groups and the drawbacks of
// small `VLEN` values.


All _cryptography-specific_ instructions defined in this Vector Crypto specification (i.e., those
in <<zvkned>>, <<zvknh,Zvknh[ab]>>, <<Zvkg>>, <<Zvksed>> and <<zvksh>> but _not_ <<zvbb>>,<<zvkb>>, or <<zvbc>>) shall
be executed with data-independent execution latency as defined in the
link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/releases/tag/v1.0.1-scalar[RISC-V Scalar Cryptography Extensions specification].
It is important to note that the Vector Crypto instructions are independent of the
implementation of the `Zkt` extension and do not require that `Zkt` is implemented.

This specification includes a <<Zvkt>> extension that, when implemented, requires certain vector instructions
(including <<zvbb>>, <<zvkb>>, and <<zvbc>>) to be executed with data-independent execution latency.

Detection of individual cryptography extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.

Instructions for accelerating

Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197

All of these instructions work on 128-bit element groups comprised of four

For the best performance, it is suggested that these instruction be implemented on systems with `VLEN`>=128.
On systems with `VLEN`<128, element groups may be formed by concatenating 32-bit elements
from two or four registers by using an LMUL =2 and LMUL=4 respectively.

// Implementations with `VLEN<128` should consider the existing
// Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>

[[zvkt,Zvkt]]
==== `Zvkt` - Vector Data-Independent Execution Latency

The Zvkt extension requires all implemented instructions from the following list to be
executed with data-independent execution latency as defined in the 
link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/releases/tag/v1.0.1-scalar[RISC-V Scalar Cryptography Extensions specification].

Data-independent execution latency (DIEL) applies to all _data operands_ of an instruction, even those that are not a
part of the body or that are inactive. However, DIEL does not apply
to other values such as vl, vtype, and the mask (when used to control
execution of a masked vector instruction).
Also, DIEL does not apply to constant values specified in the
instruction encoding such as the use of the zero register (`x0`), and, in the
case of immediate forms of an instruction, the values in the immediate
fields (i.e., imm, and uimm).

In some cases --- which are explicitly specified in the lists below
--- operands that are used as control rather than data
are exempt from DIEL.

[NOTE]
====
DIEL helps protect against side-channel timing attacks that are used
to determine data values that are intended to be kept secret. Such
values include cryptographic keys, plain text, and partially encrypted
text. DIEL is not intended to keep software (and cryptographic
algorithms contained therein) secret as it is assumed that an adversary
would already know these. This is why DIEL doesn't apply to constants
embedded in instruction encodings. 

It is important that the _values_ of elements that are not in the body or that are masked off do not affect the execution
latency of the instruction. Sometimes such elements contain data that
also needs to be kept secret.

Description:: 
A single round of the forward AES-128 KeySchedule is performed.

// Within each element group, 
The next round key is generated word by word from the
current round key element group in `vs2` and the immediately previous word of the
round key. The least significant word is generated using the most significant 
word of the current round key as well as a round constant which is selected by
the round number. 

The round number, which ranges from 1 to 10, comes from `uimm[3:0]`;
`uimm[4]` is ignored.
The out-of-range `uimm[3:0]` values of 0 and 11-15 are mapped to in-range
values by inverting `uimm[3]`. Thus, 0 maps to 8, and 11-15 maps to 3-7.
The round number is used to specify a round constant which is used in generating
the first round key word.

This instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend
on the data being operated upon.

[NOTE]
====
We chose to map out-of-range round numbers to in-range values as this allows the instruction's
behavior to be fully defined for all values of `uimm[4:0]` with minimal extra logic.

|===

Description:: 
A round-0 AES block cipher operation is performed. This operation is used for both encryption and decryption. 

There is only a `.vs` form of the instruction.
`Vs2` holds a
scalar element group that is used
as the round key for all of the round state element groups.
The new round state output of each element group is produced by XORing
the round key with each element group of `vd`.

This instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend
on the data being operated upon.

[NOTE]
====
This instruction is needed to avoid the need to "splat" a 128-bit vector register group when the round key is the same for
all 128-bit "lanes". Such a splat would typically be implemented with a `vrgather` instruction which would hurt performance
in many implementations. 
This instruction only exists in the `.vs` form because the `.vv` form would be identical to the `vxor.vv vd, vs2, vd` instruction.

====
This instruction is performance-critical to SHA3. Specifically, the Chi step of the FIPS 202 Keccak Permutation. 
Emulating it via 2 instructions is expected to have significant performance impact.
The `.vv` form of the instruction is what is needed for SHA3; the `.vx` form was added for completeness.

There is no .vi version of this instruction because the same functionality can be achieved by using an inversion
of the immediate value with the `vand.vi` instruction.

Description::
Produces the low half of 128-bit carry-less product.

Each 64-bit element in the `vs2` vector register is carry-less multiplied by 
either each 64-bit element in `vs1` (vector-vector), or the 64-bit value
from integer register `rs1` (vector-scalar). The result is the least

The 64-bit carryless multiply instructions can be used for implementing GCM in the absence of the `zvkg` extension.
We do not make these instructions exclusive as the 64-bit carryless multiply is readily derived from the
instructions in the `zvkg` extension and can have utility in other areas.
Likewise, we treat other SEW values as reserved so as not to preclude
future extensions from using this opcode with different element widths.
For example, a future extension might define an `SEW`=32 version of this instruction to enable `Zve32*` implementations to have
vector carryless multiplication instructions.

| Vd  | output | 128  | 4 | 32 | Partial-hash (Y~i+1~)
|===

Description:: 
A single "iteration" of the GHASH~H~ algorithm is performed.

This instruction treats all of the inputs and outputs as 128-bit polynomials and 
performs operations over GF[2].
It produces the next partial hash (Y~i+1~) by adding the current partial
hash (Y~i~) to the cipher text block (X~i~) and then multiplying (over GF(2^128^))
this sum by the Hash Subkey (H).

The multiplication over GF(2^128^) is a carryless multiply of two 128-bit polynomials
modulo GHASH's irreducible polynomial (x^128^ + x^7^ + x^2^ + x + 1).

The operation can be compactly defined as
// Y~i+1~ = (Y~i~ &#183; H) ^ X~i~
Y~i+1~ = ((Y~i~ ^ X~i~) &#183; H)

The NIST specification (see <<zvkg>>) orders the coefficients from left to right x~0~x~1~x~2~...x~127~
for a polynomial x~0~ + x~1~u +x~2~ u^2^ + ... + x~127~u^127^. This can be viewed as a collection of
byte elements in memory with the byte containing the lowest coefficients (i.e., 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
residing at the lowest memory address. Since the bits in the bytes are reversed, 
This instruction internally performs bit swaps within bytes to put the bits in the standard ordering
(e.g., 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0).

This instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend
on the data being operated upon.

[NOTE]
====
We are bit-reversing the bytes of inputs and outputs so that the intermediate values are consistent
with the NIST specification. These reversals are inexpensive to implement as they unconditionally
swap bit positions and therefore do not require any logic.
====

[NOTE]
====
Since the same hash subkey `H` will typically be used repeatedly on a given message,
a future extension might define a vector-scalar version of this instruction where
`vs2` is the scalar element group. This would help reduce register pressure when `LMUL` > 1.

This instruction is identical to `vghsh.vv` with vs1=0.
This instruction is often used in GHASH code. In some cases it is followed
by an XOR to perform a multiply-add. Implementations may choose to fuse these

doesn't use the add-multiply form of the `vghsh.vv` instruction.

Description::
- `SEW`=32: 2 rounds of SHA-256 compression are performed (`zvknha` and `zvknhb`)
- `SEW`=64: 2 rounds of SHA-512 compression are performed (`zvkhnb`)

Two words of `vs1` are processed with
the 8 words of current state held in `vd` and `vs1` to perform two
rounds of hash computation producing four words of the
next state.


// These instructions take in two SEW words _W1_ and _W0_ which are the next two words of the message
// schedule incremented by the appropriate constant (see
// link:https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4[FIPS PUB 180-4 Secure Hash Standard (SHS)])
// and eight SEW word variables: _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g,_ and _h_. The
// output is the new values of _a, b, e_ and _f_ after performing 2 rounds of the hash
// computation. The new values, _c_, _d_, _g_, and _h_, are equal to the input values for _a_, _b_, // _e_, _f_ respectively.

// [NOTE]
// .Note to software developers
// ====
// The MessageSchedplus constant input to this instruction is generated by Software
// increment each message schedule word by the corresponding
// round constant as defined in the NIST specification (see <<zvknh>>).
// ====

[NOTE]
.Note to software developers
====
The NIST standard (see <<zvknh>>) requires the final hash to be in big-endian byte ordering
within SEW-sized words. Since this instruction treats all words as little-endian,
software needs to perform an endian swap on the final output of this instruction
after all of the message blocks have been processed.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `vsha2ch` version of this instruction uses the two most significant message schedule
words from the element group in `vs1`
while the `vsha2cl` version uses the two least significant message schedule words.
Otherwise, these versions of the instruction are identical.
Having a high and low version of this instruction typically improves performance when 
interleaving independent hashing operations (i.e., when hashing several files at once).
====

// [NOTE]
// .Note to software developers
// ====
// These instructions take in two SEW words _W1_ and _W0_ which are the next two words of the message
// schedule incremented by the appropriate constant, 
// and eight SEW word variables: _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g,_ and _h_. The
// output is the new values of _a, b, e_ and _f_ after performing 2 rounds of the hash
// computation. The new values, _c_, _d_, _g_, and _h_, are equal to the input values for _a_, _b_, _e_, _f_ respectively.
// ====

// [NOTE]
// ====
// Between executions this instruction it is helpful to swap the register _specifiers_ for
// `vd` and `vs2`. This is because the first instruction's `vd` next state output
// (_a_, _b_, _e_, _f_)
// becomes the second instruction's `vs2` current state input (_a_, _b_, _e_, _f_).
// Likewise the first instruction's `vs2` input (_a_, _b_, _e_, _f_) "ages" to
// becomes the second instruction's `vd` current state input of (_c_, _d_, _g_, _h_).
// ====


[NOTE]
====
Preventing overlap between `vd` and `vs1` or `vs2` simplifies implementation with `VLEN < EGW`.
This restriction does not have any coding impact since proper implementation of the algorithm requires
that `vd`, `vs1` and `vs2` each are different registers.

Description::
- `SEW`=32: Four rounds of SHA-256 message schedule expansion are performed (`zvknha` and `zvknhb`)
- `SEW`=64: Four rounds of SHA-512 message schedule expansion are performed (`zvkhnb`)

Eleven of the last 16 `SEW`-sized message-schedule words from `vd` (oldest), `vs2`,
and `vs1` (most recent) are processed to produce the
next 4 message-schedule words.

[NOTE]
.Note to software developers
====
The first 16 SEW-sized words of the message schedule come from the _message block_
in big-endian byte order. Since this instruction treats all words as little endian,
software is required to endian swap these words.

All of the subsequent message schedule words are produced by this instruction and
therefore do not require an endian swap.
====

[NOTE]
.Note to software developers
====
Software is required to pack the words into element groups
as shown above in the arguments table. The indices indicate the relate age with
lower indices indicating older words.
====
// [NOTE]
// ====
// W~13~ is not used by the instruction.
// ====

// Four `SEW` message schedule words are packed into each element group of the
// source and destination registers. From a vector register point of view, 
// the message schedule words are packed into the
// element groups from the left to the right with the most significant word on the left
// and the least significant word on the right.

// `{W~3~, W~2~, W~1~, W~0~} +
// {W~7~, W~6~, W~5~, W~4~} +
// {W~11~, W~10~, W~9~, W~8~} +
// {W~15~, W~14~, W~13~, W~12~}`

// Since W~5~ through W~8~ are not needed in these calculations, we are able to compact these into
// three element groups
//
// `{W~3~, W~2~, W~1~, W~0~} +
// {W~11~, W~10~, W~9~, W~4~} +
// {W~15~, W~14~, W~13~, W~12~}`

[NOTE]
.Note to software developers
====
The {W~11~, W~10~, W~9~, W~4~} element group can easily be formed by using a vector
vmerge instruction with the appropriate mask (for example with `vl=4` and `4b0001`
as the 4 mask bits)

`vmerge.vvm {W~11~, W~10~, W~9~, W~4~}, {W~11~, W~10~, W~9~, W~8~}, {W~7~, W~6~, W~5~, W~4~}, V0`

[NOTE]
====
Preventing overlap between `vd` and `vs1` or `vs2` simplifies implementation with `VLEN < EGW`.
This restriction does not have any coding impact since proper implementation of the algorithm requires
that `vd`, `vs1` and `vs2` each contain different portions of the message schedule.
====

// This instruction is not masked. If any element groups are not to be processed, the _vl_
// must be set accordingly. It is not possible to skip an intermediary element group.
// `VLMUL` must be at least 1. In typical usage it is expected to be 1.
// There are three source operands: `vd`, `vs1` and `vs2`. The result

Description::
Two rounds of SM3 compression are performed.

The current state of eight 32-bit words is read in as an element group from `vd`. Eight 32-bit
message words are read in as an element group from `vs2`, although only four of them are used.
All of the 32-bit input words are byte-swapped from big endian to little endian.
These inputs are processed somewhat differently based on the round group (as specified in rnds),
and the next state is generated as an element group of eight 32-bit words.
The next state of eight 32-bit words are generated,
swapped from little endian to big endian, and are returned in
an eight-element group.

The round number is provided by the 5-bit `rnds` unsigned immediate. Legal values are 0 - 31
and indicate which group of two rounds are being performed. For example, if rnds=1,
then rounds 2 and 3 are being performed.

[NOTE]
====
The round number is used in the rotation of the constant as well to inform the
behavior which differs between rounds 0-15 and rounds 16-63.
====

[NOTE]
====
The endian byte swapping of the input and output words enables us to align with the SM3
specification without requiring that software perform these swaps.
====

Description::
Eight rounds of SM3 message expansion are performed.


The sixteen most recent 32-bit message words are read in as two
eight-element groups from `vs1` and `vs2`. Each of these words is
swapped from big endian to little endian.
The next eight 32-bit message words are generated,
swapped from little endian to big endian, and are returned in
an eight-element group.

[NOTE]
====
The endian byte swapping of the input and output words enables us to align with the SM3
specification without requiring that software perform these swaps.
====

// NOTE
// ====
// For the best performance, it is recommended that implementations have VLEN≥256.
// When VLEN<EGW, an appropriate LMUL needs to be used by software so that elements from the 
// specified register groups can be combined to form the full element group.

[NOTE]
====
Preventing overlap between `vd` and `vs2` simplifies implementations with `VLEN < EGW`.
This restriction should not have any coding impact since the algorithm requires these
values to be preserved for generating the next 8 words.

Description::
Four rounds of the SM4 Key Expansion are performed.

Four round keys are read in as a 4-element group from `vs2`. Each of the next four round keys are generated
by iteratively XORing the last three round keys with a constant that is indexed by the Round Group Number,
performing a byte-wise substitution, and then performing XORs between rotated versions of this value
and the corresponding current round key. 

The Round group number (`rnd`) comes from `uimm[2:0]`; the bits in `uimm[4:3]` are ignored.
Round group numbers range from 0 to 7 and indicate which
group of four round keys are being generated. Round Keys range from 0-31.
For example, if `rnd`=1, then round keys 4, 5, 6, and 7 are being generated.

//  vs2 = {rK[i-4], rK[i-3],rK[i-2], rK[i-1]} // last 4 round keys
//  rnd = 0 to 7; // group of 4 rounds
//  vd (out) = {rK[i], rK[i+1],rK[i+2], rK[i+3]} // next 4 rounds keys

// Each of the 32 rounds consumes the last 4 32-bit keys along with a round constant and
// produces the next 32-bit key.


[NOTE]
====
Software needs to generate the initial round keys. This is done by XORing the 128-bit encryption key with
the system parameters: FK[0:3]

[NOTE]
====
Implementation Hint

The round constants (CK) can be generated on the fly fairly cheaply.
If the bytes of the constants are assigned an incrementing index from 0 to 127, the value of each byte is equal to its index multiplied by 7 modulo 256.
Since the results are all limited to 8 bits, the modulo operation occurs for free:

	B[n] = n + 2n + 4n;
       = 8n + ~n + 1;
====

// This instruction only returns the generated keys to the same element group as the source.
// If it is desired to have the same key in all vector groups, either the input vector groups
// need to contain the same values, or the output from a particular group needs to be "broadcast"
// to the other groups using an instruction such as vrgather.

// The number of element groups to be processed is `vl`/`EGS`.
// `vl` must be set to the number of `SEW=32` elements to be processed and
// therefore must be a multiple of `EGS=4`. +
// Likewise, `vstart` must be a multiple of `EGS=4`.

Description::
Four rounds of SM4 Encryption/Decryption are performed.

The four words of current state are read as a 4-element group from 'vd'
and the round keys are read from either the corresponding 4-element group
in `vs2` (vector-vector form) or the scalar element group in `vs2`
(vector-scalar form).
The next four words of state are generated
by iteratively XORing the last three words of the state with 
the corresponding round key, performing
a byte-wise substitution, and then performing XORs between rotated
versions of this value and the corresponding current state. 

[NOTE]
====
In SM4, encryption and decryption are identical except that decryption consumes the round keys in the reverse order.
====

[NOTE]
====
For the first  four rounds of encryption, the _current state_ is the plain text.
For the first four rounds of decryption, the _current state_ is the cipher text.
For all subsequent rounds, the _current state_ is the _next state_ from the
previous four rounds.
