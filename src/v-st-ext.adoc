== "V" Standard Extension for Vector Operations, Version 1.0

[NOTE]
====
_The base vector extension is intended to provide general support for
data-parallel execution within the 32-bit instruction encoding space,
with later vector extensions supporting richer functionality for certain
domains._
====

=== Introduction

This spec includes the complete set of currently frozen vector
instructions.  Other instructions that have been considered during
development but are not present in this document are not included in
the review and ratification process, and may be completely revised or
abandoned.  Section <<sec-vector-extensions>> lists the standard
vector extensions and which instructions and element widths are
supported by each extension.

=== Implementation-defined Constant Parameters

Each hart supporting a vector extension defines two parameters:

. The maximum size in bits of a vector element that any operation can produce or consume, _ELEN_ {ge} 8, which
must be a power of 2.
. The number of bits in a single vector register, _VLEN_ {ge} ELEN, which must be a power of 2, and must be no greater than 2^16^.

Standard vector extensions (Section <<sec-vector-extensions>>) and
architecture profiles may set further constraints on _ELEN_ and _VLEN_.

NOTE: Future extensions may allow ELEN {gt} VLEN by holding one
element using bits from multiple vector registers, but this current
proposal does not include this option.

NOTE: The upper limit on VLEN allows software to know that indices
will fit into 16 bits (largest VLMAX of 65,536 occurs for LMUL=8 and
SEW=8 with VLEN=65,536).  Any future extension beyond 64Kib per vector
register will require new configuration instructions such that
software using the old configuration instructions does not see greater
vector lengths.

The vector extension supports writing binary code that under certain
constraints will execute portably on harts with different values for
the VLEN parameter, provided the harts support the required element
types and instructions.

NOTE: Code can be written that will expose differences in
implementation parameters.

NOTE: In general, thread contexts with active vector state cannot be
migrated during execution between harts that have any difference in
VLEN or ELEN parameters.

=== Vector Extension Programmer's Model

The vector extension adds 32 vector registers, and seven unprivileged
CSRs (`vstart`, `vxsat`, `vxrm`, `vcsr`, `vtype`, `vl`, `vlenb`) to a
base scalar RISC-V ISA.

.New vector CSRs
[cols="2,2,2,10"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",options="header"]
|===
| Address | Privilege | Name   | Description

| 0x008 | URW | vstart | Vector start position
| 0x009 | URW | vxsat  | Fixed-Point Saturate Flag
| 0x00A | URW | vxrm   | Fixed-Point Rounding Mode
| 0x00F | URW | vcsr   | Vector control and status register
| 0xC20 | URO | vl     | Vector length
| 0xC21 | URO | vtype  | Vector data type register
| 0xC22 | URO | vlenb  | VLEN/8 (vector register length in bytes)
|===

NOTE: The four CSR numbers `0x00B`-`0x00E` are tentatively reserved
for future vector CSRs, some of which may be mirrored into `vcsr`.

==== Vector Registers

The vector extension adds 32 architectural vector registers,
`v0`-`v31` to the base scalar RISC-V ISA.

Each vector register has a fixed VLEN bits of state.

==== Vector Context Status in `mstatus`

A vector context status field, `VS`, is added to `mstatus[10:9]` and shadowed
in `sstatus[10:9]`.  It is defined analogously to the floating-point context
status field, `FS`.

Attempts to execute any vector instruction, or to access the vector
CSRs, raise an illegal-instruction exception when `mstatus.VS` is
set to Off.

When `mstatus.VS` is set to Initial or Clean, executing any
instruction that changes vector state, including the vector CSRs, will
change `mstatus.VS` to Dirty.
Implementations may also change `mstatus.VS` from Initial or Clean to Dirty
at any time, even when there is no change in vector state.

NOTE: Accurate setting of `mstatus.VS` is an optimization.  Software
will typically use VS to reduce context-swap overhead.

If `mstatus.VS` is Dirty, `mstatus.SD` is 1;
otherwise, `mstatus.SD` is set in accordance with existing specifications.

Implementations may have a writable `misa.V` field.  Analogous to the
way in which the floating-point unit is handled, the `mstatus.VS`
field may exist even if `misa.V` is clear.

NOTE: Allowing `mstatus.VS` to exist when `misa.V` is clear, enables
vector emulation and simplifies handling of `mstatus.VS` in systems
with writable `misa.V`.

==== Vector Context Status in `vsstatus`

When the hypervisor extension is present, a vector context status field, `VS`,
is added to `vsstatus[10:9]`.
It is defined analogously to the floating-point context status field, `FS`.

When V=1, both `vsstatus.VS` and `mstatus.VS` are in effect: attempts to
execute any vector instruction, or to access the vector CSRs, raise an
illegal-instruction exception when either field is set to Off.

When V=1 and neither `vsstatus.VS` nor `mstatus.VS` is set to Off, executing
any instruction that changes vector state, including the vector CSRs, will
change both `mstatus.VS` and `vsstatus.VS` to Dirty.
Implementations may also change `mstatus.VS` or `vsstatus.VS` from Initial or
Clean to Dirty at any time, even when there is no change in vector state.

If `vsstatus.VS` is Dirty, `vsstatus.SD` is 1;
otherwise, `vsstatus.SD` is set in accordance with existing specifications.

If `mstatus.VS` is Dirty, `mstatus.SD` is 1;
otherwise, `mstatus.SD` is set in accordance with existing specifications.

For implementations with a writable `misa.V` field,
the `vsstatus.VS` field may exist even if `misa.V` is clear.

==== Vector Type (`vtype`) Register

The read-only XLEN-wide _vector_ _type_ CSR, `vtype` provides the
default type used to interpret the contents of the vector register
file, and can only be updated by `vset{i}vl{i}` instructions. The
vector type determines the organization of elements in each
vector register, and how multiple vector registers are grouped.  The
`vtype` register also indicates how masked-off elements and elements
past the current vector length in a vector result are handled.

NOTE: Allowing updates only via the `vset{i}vl{i}` instructions
simplifies maintenance of the `vtype` register state.

The `vtype` register has five fields, `vill`, `vma`, `vta`,
`vsew[2:0]`, and `vlmul[2:0]`.  Bits `vtype[XLEN-2:8]` should be
written with zero, and non-zero values in this field are reserved.

include::images/wavedrom/vtype-format.edn[]

NOTE: A small implementation supporting ELEN=32 requires only seven
bits of state in `vtype`: two bits for `ma` and `ta`, two bits for
`vsew[1:0]` and three bits for `vlmul[2:0]`.  The illegal value
represented by `vill` can be internally encoded using the illegal 64-bit
combination in `vsew[1:0]` without requiring an additional storage
bit to hold `vill`.

NOTE: Further standard and custom vector extensions may extend these
fields to support a greater variety of data types.

NOTE: The primary motivation for the `vtype` CSR is to allow the
vector instruction set to fit into a 32-bit instruction encoding
space.  A separate `vset{i}vl{i}` instruction can be used to set `vl`
and/or `vtype` fields before execution of a vector instruction, and
implementations may choose to fuse these two instructions into a single
internal vector microop.  In many cases, the `vl` and `vtype` values
can be reused across multiple instructions, reducing the static and
dynamic instruction overhead from the `vset{i}vl{i}` instructions.  It
is anticipated that a future extended 64-bit instruction encoding
would allow these fields to be specified statically in the instruction
encoding.

===== Vector Selected Element Width (`vsew[2:0]`)

The value in `vsew` sets the dynamic _selected_ _element_ _width_
(SEW).  By default, a vector register is viewed as being divided into
VLEN/SEW elements.

.vsew[2:0] (selected element width) encoding

| 0 | 1 | 0 |   32
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   64
| 1 | X | X |   Reserved
|===

NOTE: While it is anticipated the larger `vsew[2:0]` encodings
(`100`-`111`) will be used to encode larger SEW, the encodings are
formally _reserved_ at this point.

| SEW | Elements per vector register

|===

The supported element width may vary with LMUL.

NOTE: The current set of standard vector extensions do not vary
supported element width with LMUL.  Some future extensions may support
larger SEWs only when bits from multiple vector registers are combined
using LMUL.  In this case, software that relies on large SEW should
attempt to use the largest LMUL, and hence the fewest vector register
groups, to increase the number of implementations on which the code
will run. The `vill` bit in `vtype` should be checked after setting
`vtype` to see if the configuration is supported, and an alternate
code path should be provided if it is not. Alternatively, a profile
can mandate the minimum SEW at each LMUL setting.

===== Vector Register Grouping (`vlmul[2:0]`)

Multiple vector registers can be grouped together, so that a single
vector instruction can operate on multiple vector registers.  The term
_vector_ _register_ _group_ is used herein to refer to one or more
vector registers used as a single operand to a vector instruction.
Vector register groups can be used to provide greater execution
efficiency for longer application vectors, but the main reason for
their inclusion is to allow double-width or larger elements to be
operated on with the same vector length as single-width elements.  The
vector length multiplier, _LMUL_, when greater than 1, represents the
default number of vector registers that are combined to form a vector
register group.  Implementations must support LMUL integer values of
1, 2, 4, and 8.


NOTE: The vector architecture includes instructions that take multiple
source and destination vector operands with different element widths,
but the same number of elements.  The effective LMUL (EMUL) of each
vector operand is determined by the number of registers required to
hold the elements.  For example, for a widening add operation, such as
add 32-bit values to produce 64-bit results, a double-width result
requires twice the LMUL of the single-width inputs.

LMUL can also be a fractional value, reducing the number of bits used
in a single vector register. Fractional LMUL is used to increase the
number of effective usable vector register groups when operating on
mixed-width values.

NOTE: With only integer LMUL values, a loop operating on a range of
sizes would have to allocate at least one whole vector register
(LMUL=1) for the narrowest data type and then would consume multiple
vector registers (LMUL>1) to form a vector register group for each
wider vector operand.  This can limit the number of vector register groups
available.  With fractional LMUL, the widest values need occupy only a
single vector register while narrower values can occupy a fraction of
a single vector register, allowing all 32 architectural vector
register names to be used for different values in a vector loop even
when handling mixed-width values.  Fractional LMUL implies portions of
vector registers are unused, but in some cases, having more shorter
register-resident vectors improves efficiency relative to fewer longer
register-resident vectors.

Implementations must provide fractional LMUL settings that allow the
narrowest supported type to occupy a fraction of a vector register
corresponding to the ratio of the narrowest supported type's width to
that of the largest supported type's width.  In general, the
requirement is to support LMUL {ge} SEW~MIN~/ELEN, where SEW~MIN~ is
the narrowest supported SEW value and ELEN is the widest supported SEW
value.  In the standard extensions, SEW~MIN~=8.  For
standard vector extensions with ELEN=32, fractional LMULs of 1/2 and
1/4 must be supported.  For standard vector extensions with ELEN=64,
fractional LMULs of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 must be supported.

NOTE: When LMUL < SEW~MIN~/ELEN, there is no guarantee
an implementation would have enough bits in the fractional vector
register to store at least one element, as VLEN=ELEN is a
valid implementation choice. For example, with VLEN=ELEN=32,
and SEW~MIN~=8, an LMUL of 1/8 would only provide four bits of
storage in a vector register.

For a given supported fractional LMUL setting, implementations must support
SEW settings between SEW~MIN~ and LMUL * ELEN, inclusive.

The use of `vtype` encodings with LMUL < SEW~MIN~/ELEN is
__reserved__, but implementations can set `vill` if they do not
support these configurations.

NOTE: Requiring all implementations to set `vill` in this case would
prohibit future use of this case in an extension, so to allow for a
future definition of LMUL<SEW~MIN~/ELEN behavior, we
consider the use of this case to be __reserved__.

NOTE: It is recommended that assemblers provide a warning (not an
error) if a `vsetvli` instruction attempts to write an LMUL < SEW~MIN~/ELEN.

LMUL is set by the signed `vlmul` field in `vtype` (i.e., LMUL =
2^`vlmul[2:0]`^).

The derived value VLMAX = LMUL*VLEN/SEW represents the maximum number
of elements that can be operated on with a single vector instruction
given the current SEW and LMUL settings as shown in the table below.

[cols="1,1,1,2,2,5,5"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",options="header"]
|===
  3+| vlmul[2:0] | LMUL | #groups | VLMAX      | Registers grouped with register __n__

| 1 | 0 | 0 |   -  |     -   |     -      | reserved
| 1 | 0 | 1 |   1/8|     32  | VLEN/SEW/8 | `v` __n__ (single register in group)
| 1 | 1 | 0 |   1/4|     32  | VLEN/SEW/4 | `v` __n__ (single register in group)
| 1 | 1 | 1 |   1/2|     32  | VLEN/SEW/2 | `v` __n__ (single register in group)
| 0 | 0 | 0 |   1  |     32  |   VLEN/SEW | `v` __n__ (single register in group)
| 0 | 0 | 1 |   2  |     16  | 2*VLEN/SEW | `v` __n__, `v` __n__+1
| 0 | 1 | 0 |   4  |      8  | 4*VLEN/SEW | `v` __n__, ..., `v` __n__+3
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   8  |      4  | 8*VLEN/SEW | `v` __n__, ..., `v` __n__+7
|===

When LMUL=2, the vector register group contains vector register `v`
__n__ and vector register `v` __n__+1, providing twice the vector
length in bits.  Instructions specifying an LMUL=2 vector register group
with an odd-numbered vector register are reserved.

When LMUL=4, the vector register group contains four vector registers,
and instructions specifying an LMUL=4 vector register group using vector
register numbers that are not multiples of four are reserved.

When LMUL=8, the vector register group contains eight vector
registers, and instructions specifying an LMUL=8 vector register group
using register numbers that are not multiples of eight are reserved.

Mask registers are always contained in a single vector register,
regardless of LMUL.

[[sec-agnostic]]
===== Vector Tail Agnostic and Vector Mask Agnostic `vta` and `vma`

These two bits modify the behavior of destination tail elements and
destination inactive masked-off elements respectively during the
execution of vector instructions.  The tail and inactive sets contain
element positions that are not receiving new results during a vector
operation, as defined in Section <<sec-inactive-defs>>.

All systems must support all four options:

[cols="1,1,3,3"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",options="header"]
|===
| `vta` | `vma` | Tail Elements | Inactive Elements

|   0   |   0   | undisturbed   | undisturbed
|   0   |   1   | undisturbed   | agnostic
|   1   |   0   | agnostic      | undisturbed
|   1   |   1   | agnostic      | agnostic
|===

Mask destination tail elements are always treated as tail-agnostic,
regardless of the setting of `vta`.

When a set is marked undisturbed, the corresponding set of destination
elements in a vector register group retain the value they previously
held.

When a set is marked agnostic, the corresponding set of destination
elements in any vector destination operand can either retain the value
they previously held, or are overwritten with 1s.  Within a single vector
instruction, each destination element can be either left undisturbed
or overwritten with 1s, in any combination, and the pattern of
undisturbed or overwritten with 1s is not required to be deterministic
when the instruction is executed with the same inputs.

NOTE: The agnostic policy was added to accommodate machines with
vector register renaming.  With an undisturbed policy, all elements
would have to be read from the old physical destination vector
register to be copied into the new physical destination vector
register.  This causes an inefficiency when these inactive or tail
values are not required for subsequent calculations.

NOTE: The value of all 1s instead of all 0s was chosen for the
overwrite value to discourage software developers from depending on
the value written.

NOTE: A simple in-order implementation can ignore the settings and
simply execute all vector instructions using the undisturbed
policy. The `vta` and `vma` state bits must still be provided in
`vtype` for compatibility and to support thread migration.

NOTE: An out-of-order implementation can choose to implement
tail-agnostic + mask-agnostic using tail-agnostic + mask-undisturbed
to reduce implementation complexity.

NOTE: The definition of agnostic result policy is left loose to
accommodate migrating application threads between harts on a small
in-order core (which probably leaves agnostic regions undisturbed) and
harts on a larger out-of-order core with register renaming (which
probably overwrites agnostic elements with 1s).  As it might be
necessary to restart in the middle, we allow arbitrary mixing of
agnostic policies within a single vector instruction.  This allowed
mixing of policies also enables implementations that might change
policies for different granules of a vector register, for example,
using undisturbed within a granule that is actively operated on but
renaming to all 1s for granules in the tail.

In addition, except for mask load instructions, any element in the
tail of a mask result can also be written with the value the
mask-producing operation would have calculated with `vl`=VLMAX.
Furthermore, for mask-logical instructions and `vmsbf.m`, `vmsif.m`,
`vmsof.m` mask-manipulation instructions, any element in the tail of
the result can be written with the value the mask-producing operation
would have calculated with `vl`=VLEN, SEW=8, and LMUL=8 (i.e., all
bits of the mask register can be overwritten).

NOTE: Mask tails are always treated as agnostic to reduce complexity
of managing mask data, which can be written at bit granularity.  There
appears to be little software need to support tail-undisturbed for
mask register values.  Allowing mask-generating instructions to write
back the result of the instruction avoids the need for logic to mask
out the tail, except mask loads cannot write memory values to
destination mask tails as this would imply accessing memory past
software intent.

The assembly syntax adds two mandatory flags to the `vsetvli` instruction:

----
 ta   # Tail agnostic
 tu   # Tail undisturbed
 ma   # Mask agnostic
 mu   # Mask undisturbed

 vsetvli t0, a0, e32, m4, ta, ma   # Tail agnostic, mask agnostic
 vsetvli t0, a0, e32, m4, tu, ma   # Tail undisturbed, mask agnostic
 vsetvli t0, a0, e32, m4, ta, mu   # Tail agnostic, mask undisturbed
 vsetvli t0, a0, e32, m4, tu, mu   # Tail undisturbed, mask undisturbed
----

NOTE: Prior to v0.9, when these flags were not specified on a
`vsetvli`, they defaulted to mask-undisturbed/tail-undisturbed.  The
use of `vsetvli` without these flags is deprecated, however, and
specifying a flag setting is now mandatory.  The default should
perhaps be tail-agnostic/mask-agnostic, so software has to specify
when it cares about the non-participating elements, but given the
historical meaning of the instruction prior to introduction of these
flags, it was decided to always require them in future assembly code.

===== Vector Type Illegal (`vill`)

The `vill` bit is used to encode that a previous `vset{i}vl{i}`
instruction attempted to write an unsupported value to `vtype`.

NOTE: The `vill` bit is held in bit XLEN-1 of the CSR to support
checking for illegal values with a branch on the sign bit.

If the `vill` bit is set, then any attempt to execute a vector instruction
that depends upon `vtype` will raise an illegal-instruction exception.

NOTE: `vset{i}vl{i}` and whole register loads and stores do not depend
upon `vtype`.

When the `vill` bit is set, the other XLEN-1 bits in `vtype` shall be
zero.

==== Vector Length (`vl`) Register

The _XLEN_-bit-wide read-only `vl` CSR can only be updated by the
`vset{i}vl{i}` instructions, and the _fault-only-first_ vector load
instruction variants.

The `vl` register holds an unsigned integer specifying the number of
elements to be updated with results from a vector instruction, as
further detailed in Section <<sec-inactive-defs>>.

NOTE: The number of bits implemented in `vl` depends on the
implementation's maximum vector length of the smallest supported
type. The smallest vector implementation with VLEN=32 and supporting
SEW=8 would need at least six bits in `vl` to hold the values 0-32
(VLEN=32, with LMUL=8 and SEW=8, yields VLMAX=32).

==== Vector Byte Length (`vlenb`) Register

The _XLEN_-bit-wide read-only CSR `vlenb` holds the value VLEN/8,
i.e., the vector register length in bytes.

NOTE: The value in `vlenb` is a design-time constant in any
implementation.

NOTE: Without this CSR, several instructions are needed to calculate
VLEN in bytes, and the code has to disturb current `vl` and `vtype`
settings which require them to be saved and restored.

==== Vector Start Index (`vstart`) Register

The _XLEN_-bit-wide read-write `vstart` CSR specifies the index of the
first element to be executed by a vector instruction, as described in
Section <<sec-inactive-defs>>.

Normally, `vstart` is only written by hardware on a trap on a vector
instruction, with the `vstart` value representing the element on which
the trap was taken (either a synchronous exception or an asynchronous
interrupt), and at which execution should resume after a resumable
trap is handled.

All vector instructions are defined to begin execution with the
element number given in the `vstart` CSR, leaving earlier elements in
the destination vector undisturbed, and to reset the `vstart` CSR to
zero at the end of execution.

NOTE: All vector instructions, including `vset{i}vl{i}`, reset the `vstart`
CSR to zero.

`vstart` is not modified by vector instructions that raise illegal-instruction
exceptions.

The `vstart` CSR is defined to have only enough writable bits to hold
the largest element index (one less than the maximum VLMAX).

NOTE: The maximum vector length is obtained with the largest LMUL
setting (8) and the smallest SEW setting (8), so VLMAX_max = 8*VLEN/8 = VLEN.  For example, for VLEN=256, `vstart` would have 8 bits to
represent indices from 0 through 255.

The use of `vstart` values greater than the largest element index for
the current `vtype` setting is reserved.

NOTE: It is recommended that implementations trap if `vstart` is out
of bounds.  It is not required to trap, as a possible future use of
upper `vstart` bits is to store imprecise trap information.

The `vstart` CSR is writable by unprivileged code, but non-zero
`vstart` values may cause vector instructions to run substantially
slower on some implementations, so `vstart` should not be used by
application programmers.  A few vector instructions cannot be
executed with a non-zero `vstart` value and will raise an illegal
instruction exception as defined below.

NOTE: Making `vstart` visible to unprivileged code supports user-level
threading libraries.

Implementations are permitted to raise illegal instruction exceptions when
attempting to execute a vector instruction with a value of `vstart` that the
implementation can never produce when executing that same instruction with
the same `vtype` setting.

NOTE: For example, some implementations will never take interrupts during
execution of a vector arithmetic instruction, instead waiting until the
instruction completes to take the interrupt.  Such implementations are
permitted to raise an illegal instruction exception when attempting to execute
a vector arithmetic instruction when `vstart` is nonzero.

NOTE: When migrating a software thread between two harts with
different microarchitectures, the `vstart` value might not be
supported by the new hart microarchitecture.  The runtime on the
receiving hart might then have to emulate instruction execution up to the
next supported `vstart` element position.  Alternatively, migration events
can be constrained to only occur at mutually supported `vstart`
locations.

==== Vector Fixed-Point Rounding Mode (`vxrm`) Register

The vector fixed-point rounding-mode register holds a two-bit
read-write rounding-mode field in the least-significant bits
(`vxrm[1:0]`).  The upper bits, `vxrm[XLEN-1:2]`, should be written as
zeros.

The vector fixed-point rounding-mode is given a separate CSR address
to allow independent access, but is also reflected as a field in
`vcsr`.

NOTE: A new rounding mode can be set while saving the original
rounding mode using a single `csrwi` instruction.

The fixed-point rounding algorithm is specified as follows.
Suppose the pre-rounding result is `v`, and `d` bits of that result are to be
rounded off.
Then the rounded result is `(v >> d) + r`, where `r` depends on the rounding
mode as specified in the following table.

.vxrm encoding
//[cols="1,1,4,10,5"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",cols="<,<,<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
2+| `vxrm[1:0]` | Abbreviation | Rounding Mode | Rounding increment, `r`

| 0 | 0 | rnu | round-to-nearest-up (add +0.5 LSB)          | `v[d-1]`
| 0 | 1 | rne | round-to-nearest-even                       | `v[d-1] & (v[d-2:0]{ne}0 \| v[d])`
| 1 | 0 | rdn | round-down (truncate)                       | `0`
| 1 | 1 | rod | round-to-odd (OR bits into LSB, aka "jam")  | `!v[d] & v[d-1:0]{ne}0`
|===

The rounding functions:
----
roundoff_unsigned(v, d) = (unsigned(v) >> d) + r
roundoff_signed(v, d) = (signed(v) >> d) + r
----
are used to represent this operation in the instruction descriptions below.

==== Vector Fixed-Point Saturation Flag (`vxsat`)

The `vxsat` CSR has a single read-write least-significant bit
(`vxsat[0]`) that indicates if a fixed-point instruction has had to
saturate an output value to fit into a destination format.
Bits `vxsat[XLEN-1:1]` should be written as zeros.

The `vxsat` bit is mirrored in `vcsr`.

==== Vector Control and Status (`vcsr`) Register

The `vxrm` and `vxsat` separate CSRs can also be accessed via fields
in the _XLEN_-bit-wide vector control and status CSR, `vcsr`.

.vcsr layout
[cols=">2,4,10"]

| XLEN-1:3 |       | Reserved
|  2:1 | vxrm[1:0] | Fixed-point rounding mode
|    0 | vxsat     | Fixed-point accrued saturation flag
|===

==== State of Vector Extension at Reset

The vector extension must have a consistent state at reset.  In
particular, `vtype` and `vl` must have values that can be read and
then restored with a single `vsetvl` instruction.

NOTE: It is recommended that at reset, `vtype.vill` is set, the
remaining bits in `vtype` are zero, and `vl` is set to zero.

The `vstart`, `vxrm`, `vxsat` CSRs can have arbitrary values at reset.

NOTE: Most uses of the vector unit will require an initial `vset{i}vl{i}`,
which will reset `vstart`.  The `vxrm` and `vxsat` fields should be
reset explicitly in software before use.

The vector registers can have arbitrary values at reset.

=== Mapping of Vector Elements to Vector Register State

The following diagrams illustrate how different width elements are
packed into the bytes of a vector register depending on the current
SEW and LMUL settings, as well as implementation VLEN.  Elements are
packed into each vector register with the least-significant byte in
the lowest-numbered bits.

The mapping was chosen to provide the simplest and most portable model
for software, but might appear to incur large wiring cost for wider
vector datapaths on certain operations.  The vector instruction set
was expressly designed to support implementations that internally
rearrange vector data for different SEW to reduce datapath wiring
costs, while externally preserving the simple software model.

NOTE: For example, microarchitectures can track the EEW with which a
vector register was written, and then insert additional scrambling
operations to rearrange data if the register is accessed with a
different EEW.

==== Mapping for LMUL = 1

When LMUL=1, elements are simply packed in order from the
least-significant to most-significant bits of the vector register.

NOTE: To increase readability, vector register layouts are drawn with
bytes ordered from right to left with increasing byte address.  Bits
within an element are numbered in a little-endian format with
increasing bit index from right to left corresponding to increasing
magnitude.

LMUL=1 examples.

The element index is given in hexadecimal and is shown placed at the
least-significant byte of the stored element.

==== Mapping for LMUL < 1

When LMUL < 1, only the first LMUL*VLEN/SEW elements in the vector
register are used.  The remaining space in the vector register is
treated as part of the tail, and hence must obey the vta setting.

----
 Example, VLEN=128b, LMUL=1/4

 SEW=32b           -       -       -       0
----

==== Mapping for LMUL > 1

When vector registers are grouped, the elements of the vector register
group are packed contiguously in element order beginning with the
lowest-numbered vector register and moving to the
next-highest-numbered vector register in the group once each vector
register is filled.

[[sec-mapping-mixed]]
==== Mapping across Mixed-Width Operations

The vector ISA is designed to support mixed-width operations without
requiring additional explicit rearrangement instructions.  The
recommended software strategy when operating on multiple vectors with
different precision values is to modify `vtype` dynamically to keep
SEW/LMUL constant (and hence VLMAX constant).

The following example shows four different packed element widths (8b,
16b, 32b, 64b) in a VLEN=128b implementation.  The vector register
grouping factor (LMUL) is increased by the relative element size such
that each group can hold the same number of vector elements (VLMAX=8
in this example) to simplify stripmining code.

----
Example VLEN=128b, with SEW/LMUL=16

vn        - - - - - - - - 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  SEW=8b, LMUL=1/2

----

The following table shows each possible constant SEW/LMUL operating
point for loops with mixed-width operations.  Each column represents a
constant SEW/LMUL operating point.  Entries in table are the LMUL
values that yield that column's SEW/LMUL value for the datawidth on
that row.  In each column, an LMUL setting for a datawidth indicates
that it can be aligned with the other datawidths in the same column
that also have an LMUL setting, such that all have the same VLMAX.

|===
|       7+^|            SEW/LMUL
|          | 1 |  2 |  4 |  8 | 16  | 32  |  64

| SEW=   8 | 8 |  4 |  2 |  1 | 1/2 | 1/4 |  1/8
| SEW=  16 |   |  8 |  4 |  2 |  1  | 1/2 |  1/4
| SEW=  32 |   |    |  8 |  4 |  2  |  1  |  1/2
| SEW=  64 |   |    |    |  8 |  4  |  2  |   1
|===

Larger LMUL settings can also used to simply increase vector length to
reduce instruction fetch and dispatch overheads in cases where fewer
vector register groups are needed.

[[sec-mask-register-layout]]
==== Mask Register Layout

A vector mask occupies only one vector register regardless of SEW and
LMUL.

Each element is allocated a single mask bit in a mask vector register.
The mask bit for element _i_ is located in bit _i_ of the mask
register, independent of SEW or LMUL.

=== Vector Instruction Formats

The instructions in the vector extension fit under two existing major
opcodes (LOAD-FP and STORE-FP) and one new major opcode (OP-V).

Vector loads and stores are encoded within the scalar floating-point
load and store major opcodes (LOAD-FP/STORE-FP).  The vector load and
store encodings repurpose a portion of the standard scalar
floating-point load/store 12-bit immediate field to provide further
vector instruction encoding, with bit 25 holding the standard vector
mask bit (see <<sec-vector-mask-encoding>>).

include::images/wavedrom/vmem-format.edn[]

include::images/wavedrom/valu-format.edn[]

include::images/wavedrom/vcfg-format.edn[]

Vector instructions can have scalar or vector source operands and
produce scalar or vector results, and most vector instructions can be
performed either unconditionally or conditionally under a mask.

Vector loads and stores move bit patterns between vector register
elements and memory.  Vector arithmetic instructions operate on values
held in vector register elements.

==== Scalar Operands

Scalar operands can be immediates, or taken from the `x` registers,
the `f` registers, or element 0 of a vector register.  Scalar results
are written to an `x` or `f` register or to element 0 of a vector
register.  Any vector register can be used to hold a scalar regardless
of the current LMUL setting.

NOTE: Zfinx ("F in X") is a new ISA extension where
floating-point instructions take their arguments from the integer
register file.  The vector extension is also compatible with Zfinx,
where the Zfinx vector extension has vector-scalar floating-point
instructions taking their scalar argument from the `x` registers.

NOTE: We considered but did not pursue overlaying the `f` registers on
`v` registers.  The adopted approach reduces vector register pressure,
avoids interactions with the standard calling convention, simplifies
high-performance scalar floating-point design, and provides
compatibility with the Zfinx ISA option.  Overlaying `f` with `v`
would provide the advantage of lowering the number of state bits in
some implementations, but complicates high-performance designs and
would prevent compatibility with the Zfinx ISA option.

[[sec-vec-operands]]
==== Vector Operands

Each vector operand has an _effective_ _element_ _width_ (EEW) and an
_effective_ LMUL (EMUL) that is used to determine the size and
location of all the elements within a vector register group.  By
default, for most operands of most instructions, EEW=SEW and
EMUL=LMUL.

Some vector instructions have source and destination vector operands
with the same number of elements but different widths, so that EEW and
EMUL differ from SEW and LMUL respectively but EEW/EMUL = SEW/LMUL.
For example, most widening arithmetic instructions have a source group
with EEW=SEW and EMUL=LMUL but have a destination group with EEW=2*SEW and
EMUL=2*LMUL.  Narrowing instructions have a source operand that has
EEW=2*SEW and EMUL=2*LMUL but with a destination where EEW=SEW and EMUL=LMUL.

Vector operands or results may occupy one or more vector registers
depending on EMUL, but are always specified using the lowest-numbered
vector register in the group.  Using other than the lowest-numbered
vector register to specify a vector register group is a reserved
encoding.

A vector register cannot be used to provide source operands with more
than one EEW for a single instruction.  A mask register source is
considered to have EEW=1 for this constraint.  An encoding that would
result in the same vector register being read with two or more
different EEWs, including when the vector register appears at
different positions within two or more vector register groups, is
reserved.

NOTE: In practice, there is no software benefit to reading the same
register with different EEW in the same instruction, and this
constraint reduces complexity for implementations that internally
rearrange data dependent on EEW.

A destination vector register group can overlap a source vector register
group only if one of the following holds:

- The destination EEW equals the source EEW.
- The destination EEW is smaller than the source EEW and the overlap is in
  the lowest-numbered part of the source register group (e.g., when LMUL=1,
  `vnsrl.wi v0, v0, 3` is legal, but a destination of `v1` is not).
- The destination EEW is greater than the source EEW, the source EMUL is
  at least 1, and the overlap is in the highest-numbered part of the
  destination register group (e.g., when LMUL=8, `vzext.vf4 v0, v6` is legal,
  but a source of `v0`, `v2`, or `v4` is not).

For the purpose of determining register group overlap constraints,
mask elements have EEW=1.

NOTE: The overlap constraints are designed to support resumable
exceptions in machines without register renaming.

Any instruction encoding that violates the overlap constraints is reserved.

When source and destination registers overlap and have different EEW, the
instruction is mask- and tail-agnostic, regardless of the setting of the
`vta` and `vma` bits in `vtype`.

The largest vector register group used by an instruction can not be
greater than 8 vector registers (i.e., EMUL{le}8), and if a vector
instruction would require greater than 8 vector registers in a group,
the instruction encoding is reserved.  For example, a widening
operation that produces a widened vector register group result when
LMUL=8 is reserved as this would imply a result EMUL=16.

Widened scalar values, e.g., input and output to a widening reduction
operation, are held in the first element of a vector register and
have EMUL=1.

==== Vector Masking

Masking is supported on many vector instructions.  Element operations
that are masked off (inactive) never generate exceptions.  The
destination vector register elements corresponding to masked-off
elements are handled with either a mask-undisturbed or mask-agnostic
policy depending on the setting of the `vma` bit in `vtype` (Section
<<sec-agnostic>>).

The mask value used to control execution of a masked vector
instruction is always supplied by vector register `v0`.

NOTE: Masks are held in vector registers, rather than in a separate mask
register file, to reduce total architectural state and to simplify the ISA.

NOTE: Future vector extensions may provide longer instruction
encodings with space for a full mask register specifier.

The destination vector register group for a masked vector instruction
cannot overlap the source mask register (`v0`), unless the destination
vector register is being written with a mask value (e.g., compares)
or the scalar result of a reduction.  These instruction encodings are
reserved.

NOTE: This constraint supports restart with a non-zero `vstart` value.

Other vector registers can be used to hold working mask values, and
mask vector logical operations are provided to perform predicate
calculations. [[sec-mask-vector-logical]]

As specified in Section <<sec-agnostic>>, mask destination values are
always treated as tail-agnostic, regardless of the setting of `vta`.

[[sec-vector-mask-encoding]]
===== Mask Encoding

Where available, masking is encoded in a single-bit `vm` field in the
 instruction (`inst[25]`).

[cols="1,15"]
|===
| vm | Description

| 0 | vector result, only where v0.mask[i] = 1
| 1 | unmasked
|===

Vector masking is represented in assembler code as another vector
operand, with `.t` indicating that the operation occurs when
`v0.mask[i]` is `1` (`t` for "true").  If no masking operand is
specified, unmasked vector execution (`vm=1`) is assumed.

----
    vop.v*    v1, v2, v3, v0.t  # enabled where v0.mask[i]=1, vm=0
    vop.v*    v1, v2, v3        # unmasked vector operation, vm=1
----

NOTE: Even though the current vector extensions only support one vector
mask register `v0` and only the true form of predication, the assembly
syntax writes it out in full to be compatible with future extensions
that might add a mask register specifier and support both true and
complement mask values. The `.t` suffix on the masking operand also helps
to visually encode the use of a mask.

NOTE: The `.mask` suffix is not part of the assembly syntax.
We only append it in contexts where a mask vector is subscripted,
e.g., `v0.mask[i]`.

[[sec-inactive-defs]]
==== Prestart, Active, Inactive, Body, and Tail Element Definitions

The destination element indices operated on during a vector
instruction's execution can be divided into three disjoint subsets.

* The _prestart_ elements are those whose element index is less than the
initial value in the `vstart` register.  The prestart elements do not
raise exceptions and do not update the destination vector register.

* The _body_ elements are those whose element index is greater than or equal
to the initial value in the `vstart` register, and less than the current
vector length setting in `vl`. The body can be split into two disjoint subsets:

** The _active_ elements during a vector instruction's execution are the
elements within the body and where the current mask is enabled at that element
position.  The active elements can raise exceptions and update the destination
vector register group.

** The _inactive_ elements are the elements within the body
but where the current mask is disabled at that element
position.  The inactive elements do not raise exceptions and do not
update any destination vector register group unless masked agnostic is
specified (`vtype.vma`=1), in which case inactive elements may be
overwritten with 1s.

* The _tail_ elements during a vector instruction's execution are the
elements past the current vector length setting specified in `vl`.
The tail elements do not raise exceptions, and do not update any
destination vector register group unless tail agnostic is specified
(`vtype.vta`=1), in which case tail elements may be overwritten with
1s, or with the result of the instruction in the case of
mask-producing instructions except for mask loads.  When LMUL < 1, the
tail includes the elements past VLMAX that are held in the same vector
register.

----
    for element index x
    prestart(x) = (0 <= x < vstart)
    body(x)     = (vstart <= x < vl)
    tail(x)     = (vl <= x < max(VLMAX,VLEN/SEW))
    mask(x)     = unmasked || v0.mask[x] == 1
    active(x)   = body(x) && mask(x)
    inactive(x) = body(x) && !mask(x)
----

When `vstart` {ge} `vl`, there are no body elements, and no elements
are updated in any destination vector register group, including that
no tail elements are updated with agnostic values.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements, including agnostic
elements, are updated in the destination vector register group
regardless of `vstart`.

Instructions that write an `x` register or `f` register
do so even when `vstart` {ge} `vl`, including when `vl`=0.

NOTE: Some instructions such as `vslidedown` and `vrgather` may read
indices past `vl` or even VLMAX in source vector register groups.  The
general policy is to return the value 0 when the index is greater than
VLMAX in the source vector register group.

[[sec-vector-config]]
=== Configuration-Setting Instructions (`vsetvli`/`vsetivli`/`vsetvl`)

One of the common approaches to handling a large number of elements is
"stripmining" where each iteration of a loop handles some number of elements,
and the iterations continue until all elements have been processed. The RISC-V
vector specification provides direct, portable support for this approach.
The application specifies the total number of elements to be processed (the application vector length or AVL) as a
candidate value for `vl`, and the hardware responds via a general-purpose
register with the (frequently smaller) number of elements that the hardware
will handle per iteration (stored in `vl`), based on the microarchitectural
implementation and the `vtype` setting. A straightforward loop structure,
shown in <<example-stripmine-sew>>, depicts the ease with which the code keeps
track of the remaining number of elements and the amount per iteration handled
by hardware.

A set of instructions is provided to allow rapid configuration of the
values in `vl` and `vtype` to match application needs.  The
`vset{i}vl{i}` instructions set the `vtype` and `vl` CSRs based on
their arguments, and write the new value of `vl` into `rd`.

----
 vsetvli rd, rs1, vtypei   # rd = new vl, rs1 = AVL, vtypei = new vtype setting
 vsetivli rd, uimm, vtypei # rd = new vl, uimm = AVL, vtypei = new vtype setting
 vsetvl  rd, rs1, rs2      # rd = new vl, rs1 = AVL, rs2 = new vtype value
----

include::images/wavedrom/vcfg-format.edn[]

==== `vtype` encoding

include::images/wavedrom/vtype-format.edn[]

The new `vtype` value is encoded in the immediate fields of `vsetvli`
and `vsetivli`, and in the `rs2` register for `vsetvl`.

----
 Suggested assembler names used for vset{i}vli vtypei immediate

 e8    # SEW=8b
 e16   # SEW=16b
 e32   # SEW=32b
 e64   # SEW=64b

 mf8  # LMUL=1/8
 mf4  # LMUL=1/4
 mf2  # LMUL=1/2
 m1   # LMUL=1
 m2   # LMUL=2
 m4   # LMUL=4
 m8   # LMUL=8

Examples:
    vsetvli t0, a0, e8, m1, ta, ma      # SEW= 8, LMUL=1
    vsetvli t0, a0, e8, m2, ta, ma      # SEW= 8, LMUL=2
    vsetvli t0, a0, e32, mf2, ta, ma    # SEW=32, LMUL=1/2
----

The `vsetvl` variant operates similarly to `vsetvli` except that it
takes a `vtype` value from `rs2` and can be used for context restore.

===== Unsupported `vtype` Values

If the `vtype` value is not supported by the implementation, then
the `vill` bit is set in `vtype`, the remaining bits in `vtype` are
set to zero, and the `vl` register is also set to zero.

NOTE: Earlier drafts required a trap when setting `vtype` to an
illegal value.  However, this would have added the first
data-dependent trap on a CSR write to the ISA.  Implementations could
choose to trap when illegal values are written to `vtype` instead of
setting `vill`, to allow emulation to support new configurations for
forward-compatibility.  The current scheme supports light-weight
runtime interrogation of the supported vector unit configurations by
checking if `vill` is clear for a given setting.

A `vtype` value with `vill` set is treated as an unsupported
configuration.

Implementations must consider all bits of the `vtype` value to
determine if the configuration is supported.  An unsupported value in
any location within the `vtype` value must result in `vill` being set.

NOTE: In particular, all XLEN bits of the register `vtype` argument to
the `vsetvl` instruction must be checked.  Implementations cannot
ignore fields they do not implement. All bits must be checked to
ensure that new code assuming unsupported vector features in `vtype`
traps instead of executing incorrectly on an older implementation.

==== AVL encoding

The new vector
length setting is based on AVL, which for `vsetvli` and `vsetvl` is encoded in the `rs1` and `rd`
fields as follows:

.AVL used in `vsetvli` and `vsetvl` instructions
[cols="2,2,10,10"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",options="header"]
|===
|  `rd`  | `rs1`  | AVL value         | Effect on `vl`
|  -     | !x0    | Value in `x[rs1]` | Normal stripmining
| !x0    |  x0    | ~0                | Set `vl` to VLMAX
|  x0    |  x0    | Value in `vl` register | Keep existing `vl` (of course, `vtype` may change)
|===

When `rs1` is not `x0`, the AVL is an unsigned integer held in the `x`
register specified by `rs1`, and the new `vl` value is also written to
the `x` register specified by `rd`.

When `rs1=x0` but `rd!=x0`, the maximum unsigned integer value (`~0`)
is used as the AVL, and the resulting VLMAX is written to `vl` and
also to the `x` register specified by `rd`.

When `rs1=x0` and `rd=x0`, the instruction operates as if the current
vector length in `vl` is used as the AVL, and the resulting value is
written to `vl`, but not to a destination register.  This form can
only be used when VLMAX and hence `vl` is not actually changed by the
new SEW/LMUL ratio.  Use of the instruction with a new SEW/LMUL ratio
that would result in a change of VLMAX is reserved.
Use of the instruction is also reserved if `vill` was 1 beforehand.
Implementations may set `vill` in either case.

NOTE: This last form of the instructions allows the `vtype` register to
be changed while maintaining the current `vl`, provided VLMAX is not
reduced.  This design was chosen to ensure `vl` would always hold a
legal value for current `vtype` setting.  The current `vl` value can
be read from the `vl` CSR.  The `vl` value could be reduced by this
instruction if the new SEW/LMUL ratio causes VLMAX to shrink, and so
this case has been reserved as it is not clear this is a generally
useful operation, and implementations can otherwise assume `vl` is not
changed by this instruction to optimize their microarchitecture.

For the `vsetivli` instruction, the AVL is encoded as a 5-bit
zero-extended immediate (0--31) in the `rs1` field.

NOTE: The encoding of AVL for `vsetivli` is the same as for regular
CSR immediate values.

NOTE: The `vsetivli` instruction provides more compact code when the
dimensions of vectors are small and known to fit inside the vector
registers, in which case there is no stripmining overhead.

[[constraints-on-setting-vl]]
==== Constraints on Setting `vl`

The `vset{i}vl{i}` instructions first set VLMAX according to their `vtype`
argument, then set `vl` obeying the following constraints:

. `vl = AVL` if `AVL {le} VLMAX`
. `ceil(AVL / 2) {le} vl {le} VLMAX` if `AVL < (2 * VLMAX)`
. `vl = VLMAX` if `AVL {ge} (2 * VLMAX)`
. Deterministic on any given implementation for same input AVL and VLMAX values
. These specific properties follow from the prior rules:
.. `vl = 0` if  `AVL = 0`
.. `vl > 0` if `AVL > 0`
.. `vl {le} VLMAX`
.. `vl {le} AVL`
.. a value read from `vl` when used as the AVL argument to `vset{i}vl{i}` results in the same
value in `vl`, provided the resultant VLMAX equals the value of VLMAX at the time that `vl` was read

[NOTE]
--
The `vl` setting rules are designed to be sufficiently strict to
preserve `vl` behavior across register spills and context swaps for
`AVL {le} VLMAX`, yet flexible enough to enable implementations to improve
vector lane utilization for `AVL > VLMAX`.

For example, this permits an implementation to set `vl = ceil(AVL / 2)`
for `VLMAX < AVL < 2*VLMAX` in order to evenly distribute work over the
last two iterations of a stripmine loop.
Requirement 2 ensures that the first stripmine iteration of reduction
loops uses the largest vector length of all iterations, even in the case
of `AVL < 2*VLMAX`.
This allows software to avoid needing to explicitly calculate a running
maximum of vector lengths observed during a stripmined loop.
Requirement 2 also allows an implementation to set vl to VLMAX for `VLMAX < AVL < 2*VLMAX`

=== Vector Loads and Stores

Vector loads and stores move values between vector registers and
memory.
Vector loads and stores can be masked, and they only access memory or raise
exceptions for active elements.
Masked vector loads do not update inactive elements in the destination vector
register group, unless masked agnostic is specified (`vtype.vma`=1).
All vector loads and stores may
generate and accept a non-zero `vstart` value.

==== Vector Load/Store Instruction Encoding

Vector loads and stores are encoded within the scalar floating-point
load and store major opcodes (LOAD-FP/STORE-FP).  The vector load and
store encodings repurpose a portion of the standard scalar
floating-point load/store 12-bit immediate field to provide further
vector instruction encoding, with bit 25 holding the standard vector
mask bit (see <<sec-vector-mask-encoding>>).

|===

Vector memory unit-stride and constant-stride operations directly
encode EEW of the data to be transferred statically in the instruction
to reduce the number of `vtype` changes when accessing memory in a
mixed-width routine.  Indexed operations use the explicit EEW encoding
in the instruction to set the size of the indices used, and use
SEW/LMUL to specify the data width.

==== Vector Load/Store Addressing Modes

The vector extension supports unit-stride, strided, and
indexed (scatter/gather) addressing modes.  Vector load/store base
registers and strides are taken from the GPR `x` registers.

The base effective address for all vector accesses is given by the
contents of the `x` register named in `rs1`.

Vector unit-stride operations access elements stored contiguously in
memory starting from the base effective address.

Vector constant-strided operations access the first memory element at the base
effective address, and then access subsequent elements at address
increments given by the byte offset contained in the `x` register
specified by `rs2`.

Vector indexed operations add the contents of each element of the
vector offset operand specified by `vs2` to the base effective address
to give the effective address of each element.  The data vector
register group has EEW=SEW, EMUL=LMUL, while the offset vector
register group has EEW encoded in the instruction and
EMUL=(EEW/SEW)*LMUL.

The vector offset operand is treated as a vector of byte-address
offsets.

NOTE: The indexed operations can also be used to access fields within
a vector of objects, where the `vs2` vector holds pointers to the base
of the objects and the scalar `x` register holds the offset of the
member field in each object.  Supporting this case is why the indexed
operations were not defined to scale the element indices by the data
EEW.

If the vector offset elements are narrower than XLEN, they are
zero-extended to XLEN before adding to the base effective address.  If
the vector offset elements are wider than XLEN, the least-significant
XLEN bits are used in the address calculation.  An implementation must
raise an illegal instruction exception if the EEW is not supported for
offset elements.

NOTE: A profile may place an upper limit on the maximum supported index
EEW (e.g., only up to XLEN) smaller than ELEN.

The vector addressing modes are encoded using the 2-bit `mop[1:0]`
field.

|===

Vector unit-stride and constant-stride memory accesses do not
guarantee ordering between individual element accesses.  The vector
indexed load and store memory operations have two forms, ordered and
unordered.  The indexed-ordered variants preserve element ordering on
memory accesses.

For unordered instructions (`mop[1:0]`!=11) there is no guarantee on
element access order.  If the accesses are to a strongly ordered IO
region, the element accesses can be initiated in any order.

NOTE: To provide ordered vector accesses to a strongly ordered IO
region, the ordered indexed instructions should be used.

For implementations with precise vector traps, exceptions on
indexed-unordered stores must also be precise.

Additional unit-stride vector addressing modes are encoded using the
5-bit `lumop` and `sumop` fields in the unit-stride load and store
instruction encodings respectively.

The `nf[2:0]` field encodes the number of fields in each segment.  For
regular vector loads and stores, `nf`=0, indicating that a single
value is moved between a vector register group and memory at each
element position.  Larger values in the `nf` field are used to access
multiple contiguous fields within a segment as described below in
Section <<sec-aos>>.

The `nf[2:0]` field also encodes the number of whole vector registers
to transfer for the whole vector register load/store instructions.

[[sec-vector-loadstore-width-encoding]]
==== Vector Load/Store Width Encoding

Vector loads and stores have an EEW encoded directly in the
instruction.  The corresponding EMUL is calculated as EMUL =
(EEW/SEW)*LMUL. If the EMUL would be out of range (EMUL>8 or
EMUL<1/8), the instruction encoding is reserved.  The vector register
groups must have legal register specifiers for the selected EMUL,
otherwise the instruction encoding is reserved.

Vector unit-stride and constant-stride use the EEW/EMUL encoded in the
instruction for the data values, while vector indexed loads and stores
use the EEW/EMUL encoded in the instruction for the index values and
the SEW/LMUL encoded in `vtype` for the data values.

Vector loads and stores are encoded using width values that are not
claimed by the standard scalar floating-point loads and stores.

Implementations must provide vector loads and stores with EEWs
corresponding to all supported SEW settings.  Vector load/store
encodings for unsupported EEW widths must raise an illegal
instruction exception.

Index bits is the size of each index accessed in register.

# Vector unit-stride loads and stores

vle8.v    vd, (rs1), vm  #    8-bit unit-stride load

vle32.v   vd, (rs1), vm  #   32-bit unit-stride load
vle64.v   vd, (rs1), vm  #   64-bit unit-stride load

# vs3 store data, rs1 base address, vm is mask encoding (v0.t or <missing>)

vse32.v   vs3, (rs1), vm  #   32-bit unit-stride store
vse64.v   vs3, (rs1), vm  #   64-bit unit-stride store
----

Additional unit-stride mask load and store instructions are
provided to transfer mask values to/from memory.  These
operate similarly to unmasked byte loads or stores (EEW=8), except that
the effective vector length is ``evl``=ceil(``vl``/8) (i.e. EMUL=1),
and the destination register is always written with a tail-agnostic
policy.

----
# Vector unit-stride mask load
vlm.v vd, (rs1)   #  Load byte vector of length ceil(vl/8)

# Vector unit-stride mask store
vsm.v vs3, (rs1)  #  Store byte vector of length ceil(vl/8)
----

`vlm.v` and `vsm.v` are encoded with the same `width[2:0]`=0 encoding as
`vle8.v` and `vse8.v`, but are distinguished by different
`lumop` and `sumop` encodings.  Since `vlm.v` and `vsm.v` operate as byte loads and stores,
`vstart` is in units of bytes for these instructions.

NOTE: `vlm.v` and `vsm.v` respect the `vill` field in `vtype`, as
they depend on `vtype` indirectly through its constraints on `vl`.

NOTE: The previous assembler mnemonics `vle1.v` and `vse1.v` were
confusing as length was handled differently for these instructions
versus other element load/store instructions.  To avoid software
churn, these older assembly mnemonics are being retained as aliases.

NOTE: The primary motivation to provide mask load and store is to
support machines that internally rearrange data to reduce
cross-datapath wiring.  However, these instructions also provide a convenient
mechanism to use packed bit vectors in memory as mask values,
and also reduce the cost of mask spill/fill by reducing need to change
`vl`.

==== Vector Strided Instructions

----
# Vector strided loads and stores

# vd destination, rs1 base address, rs2 byte stride
vlse8.v    vd, (rs1), rs2, vm  #    8-bit strided load
vlse16.v   vd, (rs1), rs2, vm  #   16-bit strided load
vlse32.v   vd, (rs1), rs2, vm  #   32-bit strided load
vlse64.v   vd, (rs1), rs2, vm  #   64-bit strided load

# vs3 store data, rs1 base address, rs2 byte stride
vsse8.v    vs3, (rs1), rs2, vm  #    8-bit strided store
vsse16.v   vs3, (rs1), rs2, vm  #   16-bit strided store
vsse32.v   vs3, (rs1), rs2, vm  #   32-bit strided store
vsse64.v   vs3, (rs1), rs2, vm  #   64-bit strided store
----

Negative and zero strides are supported.

Element accesses within a strided instruction are unordered with
respect to each other.

When `rs2`=`x0`, then an implementation is allowed, but not required,
to perform fewer memory operations than the number of active elements,
and may perform different numbers of memory operations across
different dynamic executions of the same static instruction.

NOTE: Compilers must be aware to not use the `x0` form for rs2 when
the immediate stride is `0` if the intent is to require all memory
accesses are performed.

When `rs2!=x0` and the value of `x[rs2]=0`, the implementation must
perform one memory access for each active element (but these accesses
will not be ordered).

NOTE: As with other architectural mandates, implementations must
_appear_ to perform each memory access. Microarchitectures are
free to optimize away accesses that would not be observed by another
agent, for example, in idempotent memory regions obeying RVWMO.  For
non-idempotent memory regions, where by definition each access can be
observed by a device, the optimization would not be possible.

NOTE: When repeating ordered vector accesses to the same memory
address are required, then an ordered indexed operation can be used.

vsoxei64.v   vs3, (rs1), vs2, vm  # ordered 64-bit indexed store of SEW data
----

NOTE: The assembler syntax for indexed loads and stores uses
``ei``__x__ instead of ``e``__x__ to indicate the statically encoded EEW
is of the index not the data.

NOTE: The indexed operations mnemonics have a "U" or "O" to
distinguish between unordered and ordered, while the other vector
addressing modes have no character. While this is perhaps a little
less consistent, this approach minimizes disruption to existing
software, as VSXEI previously meant "ordered" - and the opcode can be
retained as an alias during transition to help reduce software churn.

==== Unit-stride Fault-Only-First Loads

The unit-stride fault-only-first load instructions are used to
vectorize loops with data-dependent exit conditions ("while" loops).
These instructions execute as a regular load except that they will
only take a trap caused by a synchronous exception on element 0.  If
element 0 raises an exception, `vl` is not modified, and the trap is
taken.  If an element > 0 raises an exception, the corresponding trap
is not taken, and the vector length `vl` is reduced to the index of
the element that would have raised an exception.

Load instructions may overwrite active destination vector register
group elements past the element index at which the trap is reported.
Similarly, fault-only-first load instructions may update active destination
elements past the element that causes trimming of the vector length
(but not past the original vector length).  The values of these
spurious updates do not have to correspond to the values in memory at
the addressed memory locations.  Non-idempotent memory locations can
only be accessed when it is known the corresponding element load
operation will not be restarted due to a trap or vector-length
trimming.

strlen example using unit-stride fault-only-first instruction

include::example/strlen.s[lines=4..-1]
----

NOTE: There is a security concern with fault-on-first loads, as they
can be used to probe for valid effective addresses.  The unit-stride
versions only allow probing a region immediately contiguous to a known
region, and so reduce the security impact when used in unprivileged
code.  However, code running in S-mode can establish arbitrary page
translations that allow probing of random guest physical addresses
provided by a hypervisor.  Strided and scatter/gather fault-only-first
instructions are not provided due to lack of encoding space, but they
can also represent a larger security hole, allowing even unprivileged
software to easily check multiple random pages for accessibility
without experiencing a trap.  This standard does not address possible
security mitigations for fault-only-first instructions.

Even when an exception is not raised, implementations are permitted to process
fewer than `vl` elements and reduce `vl` accordingly, but if `vstart`=0 and
`vl`>0, then at least one element must be processed.

When the fault-only-first instruction takes a trap due to an
interrupt, implementations should not reduce `vl` and should instead
set a `vstart` value.

NOTE: When the fault-only-first instruction would trigger a debug
data-watchpoint trap on an element after the first, implementations
should not reduce `vl` but instead should trigger the debug trap as
otherwise the event might be lost.

[[sec-aos]]
==== Vector Load/Store Segment Instructions

The vector load/store segment instructions move multiple contiguous
fields in memory to and from consecutively numbered vector registers.

NOTE: The name "segment" reflects that the items moved are subarrays
with homogeneous elements.  These operations can be used to transpose
arrays between memory and registers, and can support operations on
"array-of-structures" datatypes by unpacking each field in a structure
into a separate vector register.

The three-bit `nf` field in the vector instruction encoding is an
unsigned integer that contains one less than the number of fields per
segment, _NFIELDS_.

| 1 | 1 | 1 | 8
|===

The EMUL setting must be such that EMUL * NFIELDS {le} 8, otherwise
the instruction encoding is reserved.

NOTE: The product ceil(EMUL) * NFIELDS represents the number of underlying
vector registers that will be touched by a segmented load or store
instruction.  This constraint makes this total no larger than 1/4 of
the architectural register file, and the same as for regular
operations with EMUL=8.

Each field will be held in successively numbered vector register
groups.  When EMUL>1, each field will occupy a vector register group
held in multiple successively numbered vector registers, and the
vector register group for each field must follow the usual vector
register alignment constraints (e.g., when EMUL=2 and NFIELDS=4, each
field's vector register group must start at an even vector register,
but does not have to start at a multiple of 8 vector register number).

If the vector register numbers accessed by the segment load or store
would increment past 31, then the instruction encoding is reserved.

NOTE: This constraint is to help allow for forward-compatibility with
a possible future longer instruction encoding that has more
addressable vector registers.

The `vl` register gives the number of segments to move, which is
equal to the number of elements transferred to each vector register
group.  Masking is also applied at the level of whole segments.

For segment loads and stores, the individual memory accesses used to
access fields within each segment are unordered with respect to each
other even for ordered indexed segment loads and stores.

The `vstart` value is in units of whole segments.  If a trap occurs during
access to a segment, it is implementation-defined whether a subset
of the faulting segment's accesses are performed before the trap is taken.

===== Vector Unit-Stride Segment Loads and Stores

The vector unit-stride load and store segment instructions move packed
contiguous segments into multiple destination vector register groups.

NOTE: Where the segments hold structures with heterogeneous-sized
fields, software can later unpack individual structure fields using
additional instructions after the segment load brings data into the
vector registers.

The assembler prefixes `vlseg`/`vsseg` are used for unit-stride
segment loads and stores respectively.

----
# Format
vlseg<nf>e<eew>.v vd, (rs1), vm      # Unit-stride segment load template
vsseg<nf>e<eew>.v vs3, (rs1), vm     # Unit-stride segment store template

# Examples
vlseg8e8.v vd, (rs1), vm   # Load eight vector registers with eight byte fields.

vsseg3e32.v vs3, (rs1), vm  # Store packed vector of 3*4-byte segments from vs3,vs3+1,vs3+2 to memory
----

For loads, the `vd` register will hold the first field loaded from the
segment.  For stores, the `vs3` register is read to provide the first
field to be stored to each segment.

----
# Example 1
# Memory structure holds packed RGB pixels (24-bit data structure, 8bpp)
vsetvli a1, t0, e8, m1, ta, ma
vlseg3e8.v v8, (a0), vm
# v8 holds the red pixels
# v9 holds the green pixels
# v10 holds the blue pixels

# Example 2
# Memory structure holds complex values, 32b for real and 32b for imaginary
vsetvli a1, t0, e32, m1, ta, ma
vlseg2e32.v v8, (a0), vm
# v8 holds real
# v9 holds imaginary
----

There are also fault-only-first versions of the unit-stride instructions.

----
# Template for vector fault-only-first unit-stride segment loads.
vlseg<nf>e<eew>ff.v vd, (rs1),  vm    # Unit-stride fault-only-first segment loads
----

For fault-only-first segment loads, if an exception is detected partway
through accessing a segment, regardless of whether the element index is zero,
it is implementation-defined whether a subset of the segment is loaded.

These instructions may overwrite destination vector register group
elements past the point at which a trap is reported or past the point
at which vector length is trimmed.

===== Vector Strided Segment Loads and Stores

Vector strided segment loads and stores move contiguous segments where
each segment is separated by the byte-stride offset given in the `rs2`
GPR argument.

NOTE: Negative and zero strides are supported.

----
# Format
vlsseg<nf>e<eew>.v vd, (rs1), rs2, vm          # Strided segment loads
vssseg<nf>e<eew>.v vs3, (rs1), rs2, vm         # Strided segment stores

# Examples
vsetvli a1, t0, e8, m1, ta, ma
vlsseg3e8.v v4, (x5), x6   # Load bytes at addresses x5+i*x6   into v4[i],
                            #  and bytes at addresses x5+i*x6+1 into v5[i],
                            #  and bytes at addresses x5+i*x6+2 into v6[i].

# Examples
vsetvli a1, t0, e32, m1, ta, ma
vssseg2e32.v v2, (x5), x6   # Store words from v2[i] to address x5+i*x6
                            #   and words from v3[i] to address x5+i*x6+4
----

Accesses to the fields within each segment can occur in any order,
including the case where the byte stride is such that segments overlap
in memory.

===== Vector Indexed Segment Loads and Stores

Vector indexed segment loads and stores move contiguous segments where
each segment is located at an address given by adding the scalar base
address in the `rs1` field to byte offsets in vector register `vs2`.
Both ordered and unordered forms are provided, where the ordered forms
access segments in element order.  However, even for the ordered form,
accesses to the fields within an individual segment are not ordered
with respect to each other.

The data vector register group has EEW=SEW, EMUL=LMUL, while the index
vector register group has EEW encoded in the instruction with
EMUL=(EEW/SEW)*LMUL.
The EMUL * NFIELDS {le} 8 constraint applies to the data vector register group.

----
# Format
vluxseg<nf>ei<eew>.v vd, (rs1), vs2, vm   # Indexed-unordered segment loads
vloxseg<nf>ei<eew>.v vd, (rs1), vs2, vm   # Indexed-ordered segment loads
vsuxseg<nf>ei<eew>.v vs3, (rs1), vs2, vm  # Indexed-unordered segment stores
vsoxseg<nf>ei<eew>.v vs3, (rs1), vs2, vm  # Indexed-ordered segment stores

# Examples
vsetvli a1, t0, e8, m1, ta, ma
vluxseg3ei8.v v4, (x5), v3   # Load bytes at addresses x5+v3[i]   into v4[i],
                                #  and bytes at addresses x5+v3[i]+1 into v5[i],
                                #  and bytes at addresses x5+v3[i]+2 into v6[i].

# Examples
vsetvli a1, t0, e32, m1, ta, ma
vsuxseg2ei32.v v2, (x5), v5   # Store words from v2[i] to address x5+v5[i]
                                #   and words from v3[i] to address x5+v5[i]+4
----

For vector indexed segment loads, the destination vector register
groups cannot overlap the source vector register group (specified by
`vs2`), else the instruction encoding is reserved.

NOTE: This constraint supports restart of indexed segment loads
that raise exceptions partway through loading a structure.

These instructions load and store whole vector register groups.

NOTE: These instructions are intended to be used to save and restore
vector registers when the type or length of the current contents of
the vector register is not known, or where modifying `vl` and `vtype`
would be costly. Examples include compiler register spills, vector
function calls where values are passed in vector registers, interrupt
handlers, and OS context switches.  Software can determine the number
of bytes transferred by reading the `vlenb` register.

The load instructions have an EEW encoded in the `mew` and `width`
fields following the pattern of regular unit-stride loads.

NOTE: Because in-register byte layouts are identical to in-memory byte
layouts, the same data is written to the destination register group
regardless of EEW.
Hence, it would have sufficed to provide only EEW=8 variants.
The full set of EEW variants is provided so that the encoded EEW can be used
as a hint to indicate the destination register group will next be accessed
with this EEW, which aids implementations that rearrange data internally.

The vector whole register store instructions are encoded similar to
unmasked unit-stride store of elements with EEW=8.

The `nf` field encodes how many vector registers to load and store using the NFIELDS encoding (Figure <<fig-nf>>).
The encoded number of registers must be a power of 2 and the vector
register numbers must be aligned as with a vector register group,
otherwise the instruction encoding is reserved.  NFIELDS
indicates the number of vector registers to transfer, numbered
successively after the base.  Only NFIELDS values of 1, 2, 4, 8 are
supported, with other values reserved.  When multiple registers are
transferred, the lowest-numbered vector register is held in the
lowest-numbered memory addresses and successive vector register
numbers are placed contiguously in memory.

The instructions operate with an effective vector length,
`evl`=NFIELDS*VLEN/EEW, regardless of current settings in `vtype` and
`vl`.  The usual property that no elements are written if `vstart`
{ge} `vl` does not apply to these instructions.  Instead, no elements
are written if `vstart` {ge} `evl`.

The instructions operate similarly to unmasked unit-stride load and
store instructions, with the base address passed in the scalar `x`
register specified by `rs1`.

Implementations are allowed to raise a misaligned address exception on
whole register loads and stores if the base address is not naturally
aligned to the larger of the size of the encoded EEW in bytes (EEW/8)
or the implementation's smallest supported SEW size in bytes
(SEW~MIN~/8).

NOTE: Allowing misaligned exceptions to be raised based on
non-alignment to the encoded EEW simplifies the implementation of these
instructions.  Some subset implementations might not support smaller
SEW widths, so are allowed to report misaligned exceptions for the
smallest supported SEW even if larger than encoded EEW.  An extreme
non-standard implementation might have SEW~MIN~>XLEN for example.  Software
environments can mandate the minimum alignment requirements to support
an ABI.

----

NOTE: Implementations should raise illegal instruction exceptions on
`vl<nf>r` instructions for EEW values that are not supported.

NOTE: We have considered adding a whole register mask load instruction
(`vl1rm.v`) but have decided to omit from initial extension.  The
primary purpose would be to inform the microarchitecture that the data
will be used as a mask.  The same effect can be achieved with the
following code sequence, whose cost is at most four instructions. Of
these, the first could likely be removed as `vl` is often already
in a scalar register, and the last might already be present if the
following vector instruction needs a new SEW/LMUL. So, in best case
only two instructions (of which only one performs vector operations) are needed to synthesize the effect of the
dedicated instruction:
----
csrr t0, vl                        # Save current vl (potentially not needed)
vsetvli t1, x0, e8, m8, ta, ma     # Maximum VLMAX
vlm.v v0, (a0)                     # Load mask register
vsetvli x0, t0, <new type>         # Restore vl (potentially already present)
----

=== Vector Memory Alignment Constraints

If an element accessed by a vector memory instruction is not naturally
aligned to the size of the element, either the element is transferred
successfully or an address misaligned exception is raised on that
element.

Support for misaligned vector memory accesses is independent of an
implementation's support for misaligned scalar memory accesses.

NOTE: An implementation may have neither, one, or both scalar and
vector memory accesses support some or all misaligned accesses in
hardware.  A separate PMA should be defined to determine if vector
misaligned accesses are supported in the associated address range.

Vector misaligned memory accesses follow the same rules for atomicity
as scalar misaligned memory accesses.

=== Vector Memory Consistency Model

Vector memory instructions appear to execute in program order on the
local hart.

Vector memory instructions follow RVWMO at the instruction level.
If the Ztso extension is implemented, vector memory instructions additionally
follow RVTSO at the instruction level.

Except for vector indexed-ordered loads and stores, element operations
are unordered within the instruction.

Vector indexed-ordered loads and stores read and write elements
from/to memory in element order respectively,
obeying RVWMO at the element level.

NOTE: Ztso only imposes RVTSO at the instruction level; intra-instruction
ordering follows RVWMO regardless of whether Ztso is implemented.

NOTE: More formal definitions required.

Instructions affected by the vector length register `vl` have a control
dependency on `vl`, rather than a data dependency.
Similarly, masked vector instructions have a control dependency on the source
mask register, rather than a data dependency.

NOTE: Treating the vector length and mask as control rather than data
typically matches the semantics of the corresponding scalar code, where branch
instructions ordinarily would have been used.
Treating the mask as control allows masked vector load instructions to access
memory before the mask value is known, without the need for
a misspeculation-recovery mechanism.

=== Vector Arithmetic Instruction Formats

The vector arithmetic instructions use a new major opcode (OP-V =
1010111~2~) which neighbors OP-FP.  The three-bit `funct3` field is
used to define sub-categories of vector instructions.

include::images/wavedrom/valu-format.edn[]

[[sec-arithmetic-encoding]]
==== Vector Arithmetic Instruction encoding

The `funct3` field encodes the operand type and source locations.

|===

Integer operations are performed using unsigned or two's-complement
signed integer arithmetic depending on the opcode.

NOTE: In this discussion, fixed-point operations are
considered to be integer operations.

All standard vector floating-point arithmetic operations follow the
IEEE-754/2008 standard.  All vector floating-point operations use the
dynamic rounding mode in the `frm` register.  Use of the `frm` field
when it contains an invalid rounding mode by any vector floating-point
instruction--even those that do not depend on the rounding mode, or
when `vl`=0, or when `vstart` {ge} `vl`--is reserved.

NOTE: All vector floating-point code will rely on a valid value in
`frm`.  Implementations can make all vector FP instructions report
exceptions when the rounding mode is invalid to simplify control
logic.

Vector-vector operations take two vectors of operands from vector
register groups specified by `vs2` and `vs1` respectively.

Vector-scalar operations can have three possible forms.  In all three forms,
the vector register group operand is specified by `vs2`.  The second
scalar source operand comes from one of three alternative sources:

. For integer operations, the scalar can be a 5-bit immediate, `imm[4:0]`, encoded
in the `rs1` field.  The value is sign-extended to SEW bits, unless
otherwise specified.

. For integer operations, the scalar can be taken from the scalar `x`
register specified by `rs1`.  If XLEN>SEW, the least-significant SEW
bits of the `x` register are used, unless otherwise specified.  If
XLEN<SEW, the value from the `x` register is sign-extended to SEW
bits.

. For floating-point operations, the scalar can be taken from a scalar
`f` register.  If FLEN > SEW, the value in the `f` registers is
checked for a valid NaN-boxed value, in which case the
least-significant SEW bits of the `f` register are used, else the
canonical NaN value is used.  Vector instructions where any
floating-point vector operand's EEW is not a supported floating-point
type width (which includes when FLEN < SEW) are reserved.

NOTE: Some instructions _zero_-extend the 5-bit immediate, and denote this
by naming the immediate `uimm` in the assembly syntax.

NOTE: When adding a vector extension to the Zfinx/Zdinx/Zhinx
extensions, floating-point scalar arguments are taken from the `x`
registers.  NaN-boxing is not supported in these extensions, and so
the vector floating-point scalar value is produced using the same
rules as for an integer scalar operand (i.e., when XLEN > SEW use the
lowest SEW bits, when XLEN < SEW use the sign-extended value).

Vector arithmetic instructions are masked under control of the `vm`
field.

----
# Assembly syntax pattern for vector binary arithmetic instructions

# Operations returning vector results, masked by vm (v0.t, <nothing>)
vop.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # integer vector-vector      vd[i] = vs2[i] op vs1[i]
vop.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # integer vector-scalar      vd[i] = vs2[i] op x[rs1]
vop.vi  vd, vs2, imm, vm  # integer vector-immediate   vd[i] = vs2[i] op imm

vfop.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm # FP vector-vector operation vd[i] = vs2[i] fop vs1[i]
vfop.vf  vd, vs2, rs1, vm # FP vector-scalar operation vd[i] = vs2[i] fop f[rs1]
----

NOTE: In the encoding, `vs2` is the first operand, while `rs1/imm`
is the second operand. This is the opposite to the standard scalar
ordering.  This arrangement retains the existing encoding conventions
that instructions that read only one scalar register, read it from
`rs1`, and that 5-bit immediates are sourced from the `rs1` field.

----
# Assembly syntax pattern for vector ternary arithmetic instructions (multiply-add)

# Integer operations overwriting sum input
vop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vs2[i] + vd[i]
vop.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = x[rs1] * vs2[i] + vd[i]

# Integer operations overwriting product input
vop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vd[i] + vs2[i]
vop.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = x[rs1] * vd[i] + vs2[i]

# Floating-point operations overwriting sum input
vfop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vs2[i] + vd[i]
vfop.vf vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = f[rs1] * vs2[i] + vd[i]

# Floating-point operations overwriting product input
vfop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vd[i] + vs2[i]
vfop.vf vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = f[rs1] * vd[i] + vs2[i]
----

NOTE: For ternary multiply-add operations, the assembler syntax always
places the destination vector register first, followed by either `rs1`
or `vs1`, then `vs2`.  This ordering provides a more natural reading
of the assembler for these ternary operations, as the multiply
operands are always next to each other.

[[sec-widening]]
==== Widening Vector Arithmetic Instructions

A few vector arithmetic instructions are defined to be __widening__
operations where the destination vector register group has EEW=2*SEW
and EMUL=2*LMUL.  These are generally given a `vw*` prefix on the
opcode, or `vfw*` for vector floating-point instructions.

The first vector register group operand can be either single or
double-width.

----
# Assembly syntax pattern for vector widening arithmetic instructions

# Double-width result, two single-width sources: 2*SEW = SEW op SEW
vwop.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # integer vector-vector      vd[i] = vs2[i] op vs1[i]
vwop.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # integer vector-scalar      vd[i] = vs2[i] op x[rs1]

# Double-width result, first source double-width, second source single-width: 2*SEW = 2*SEW op SEW
vwop.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # integer vector-vector      vd[i] = vs2[i] op vs1[i]
vwop.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # integer vector-scalar      vd[i] = vs2[i] op x[rs1]
----

NOTE: Originally, a `w` suffix was used on opcode, but this could be
confused with the use of a `w` suffix to mean word-sized operations in
doubleword integers, so the `w` was moved to prefix.

NOTE: The floating-point widening operations were changed to `vfw*`
from `vwf*` to be more consistent with any scalar widening
floating-point operations that will be written as `fw*`.

Widening instruction encodings must follow the constraints in Section
<<sec-vec-operands>>.

[[sec-narrowing]]
==== Narrowing Vector Arithmetic Instructions

A few instructions are provided to convert double-width source vectors
into single-width destination vectors.  These instructions convert a
vector register group specified by `vs2` with EEW/EMUL=2*SEW/2*LMUL to a vector register
group with the current SEW/LMUL setting.  Where there is a second
source vector register group (specified by `vs1`), this has the same
(narrower) width as the result (i.e., EEW=SEW).

NOTE: An alternative design decision would have been to treat SEW/LMUL
as defining the size of the source vector register group.  The choice
here is motivated by the belief the chosen approach will require fewer
`vtype` changes.

NOTE: Compare operations that set a mask register are also
implicitly a narrowing operation.

A `vn*` prefix on the opcode is used to distinguish these instructions
in the assembler, or a `vfn*` prefix for narrowing floating-point
opcodes.  The double-width source vector register group is signified
by a `w` in the source operand suffix (e.g., `vnsra.wv`)

----

unsigned variants, depending on whether the narrower source operands
are first sign- or zero-extended before forming the double-width sum.

----
# Widening unsigned integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = SEW +/- SEW
vwaddu.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwaddu.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vwsubu.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwsubu.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Widening signed integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = SEW +/- SEW
vwadd.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwadd.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vwsub.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector

# Widening unsigned integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = 2*SEW +/- SEW
vwaddu.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector

# Widening signed integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = 2*SEW +/- SEW
vwadd.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwadd.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vwsub.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwsub.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
----

NOTE: An integer value can be doubled in width using the widening add
instructions with a scalar operand of `x0`.  Assembly
pseudoinstructions `vwcvt.x.x.v vd,vs,vm` = `vwadd.vx vd,vs,x0,vm` and
`vwcvtu.x.x.v vd,vs,vm` = `vwaddu.vx vd,vs,x0,vm` are provided.

==== Vector Integer Extension

The vector integer extension instructions zero- or sign-extend a
source vector integer operand with EEW less than SEW to fill SEW-sized
elements in the destination.  The EEW of the source is 1/2, 1/4, or
1/8 of SEW, while EMUL of the source is (EEW/SEW)*LMUL.  The
destination has EEW equal to SEW and EMUL equal to LMUL.

----
vzext.vf2 vd, vs2, vm  # Zero-extend SEW/2 source to SEW destination
vsext.vf2 vd, vs2, vm  # Sign-extend SEW/2 source to SEW destination
vzext.vf4 vd, vs2, vm  # Zero-extend SEW/4 source to SEW destination
vsext.vf4 vd, vs2, vm  # Sign-extend SEW/4 source to SEW destination
vzext.vf8 vd, vs2, vm  # Zero-extend SEW/8 source to SEW destination
vsext.vf8 vd, vs2, vm  # Sign-extend SEW/8 source to SEW destination
----

If the source EEW is not a supported width, or source EMUL would be
below the minimum legal LMUL, the instruction encoding is reserved.

NOTE: Standard vector load instructions access memory values that are
the same size as the destination register elements.  Some application
code needs to operate on a range of operand widths in a wider element,
for example, loading a byte from memory and adding to an eight-byte
element.  To avoid having to provide the cross-product of the number
of vector load instructions by the number of data types (byte, word,
halfword, and also signed/unsigned variants), we instead add explicit
extension instructions that can be used if an appropriate widening
arithmetic instruction is not available.

==== Vector Integer Add-with-Carry / Subtract-with-Borrow Instructions

To support multi-word integer arithmetic, instructions that operate on
a carry bit are provided.  For each operation (add or subtract), two
instructions are provided: one to provide the result (SEW width), and
the second to generate the carry output (single bit encoded as a mask
boolean).

The carry inputs and outputs are represented using the mask register
layout as described in Section <<sec-mask-register-layout>>.  Due to
encoding constraints, the carry input must come from the implicit `v0`
register, but carry outputs can be written to any vector register that
respects the source/destination overlap restrictions.

`vadc` and `vsbc` add or subtract the source operands and the carry-in or
borrow-in, and write the result to vector register `vd`.
These instructions are encoded as masked instructions (`vm=0`), but they operate
on and write back all body elements.
Encodings corresponding to the unmasked versions (`vm=1`) are reserved.

`vmadc` and `vmsbc` add or subtract the source operands, optionally
add the carry-in or subtract the borrow-in if masked (`vm=0`), and
write the result back to mask register `vd`.  If unmasked (`vm=1`),
there is no carry-in or borrow-in.  These instructions operate on and
write back all body elements, even if masked.  Because these
instructions produce a mask value, they always operate with a
tail-agnostic policy.

----
 # Produce sum with carry.

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] + vs1[i] + v0.mask[i]
 vadc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] + x[rs1] + v0.mask[i]
 vadc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] + imm + v0.mask[i]
 vadc.vim   vd, vs2, imm, v0  # Vector-immediate

 # Produce carry out in mask register format

 # vd.mask[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + vs1[i] + v0.mask[i])
 vmadc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

 # vd.mask[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + x[rs1] + v0.mask[i])
 vmadc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

 # vd.mask[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + imm + v0.mask[i])
 vmadc.vim   vd, vs2, imm, v0  # Vector-immediate

 # vd.mask[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + vs1[i])
 vmadc.vv    vd, vs2, vs1      # Vector-vector, no carry-in

 # vd.mask[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + x[rs1])
 vmadc.vx    vd, vs2, rs1      # Vector-scalar, no carry-in

 # vd.mask[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + imm)
 vmadc.vi    vd, vs2, imm      # Vector-immediate, no carry-in
----

Because implementing a carry propagation requires executing two
instructions with unchanged inputs, destructive accumulations will
require an additional move to obtain correct results.

----
# Example multi-word arithmetic sequence, accumulating into v4
vmadc.vvm v1, v4, v8, v0  # Get carry into temp register v1
vadc.vvm v4, v4, v8, v0   # Calc new sum
vmmv.m v0, v1             # Move temp carry into v0 for next word
----

The subtract with borrow instruction `vsbc` performs the equivalent
function to support long word arithmetic for subtraction.  There are
no subtract with immediate instructions.

----
# Produce difference with borrow.

# vd[i] = vs2[i] - vs1[i] - v0.mask[i]
vsbc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

# vd[i] = vs2[i] - x[rs1] - v0.mask[i]
vsbc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

# Produce borrow out in mask register format

# vd.mask[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - vs1[i] - v0.mask[i])
vmsbc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

# vd.mask[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - x[rs1] - v0.mask[i])
vmsbc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

# vd.mask[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - vs1[i])
vmsbc.vv    vd, vs2, vs1      # Vector-vector, no borrow-in

# vd.mask[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - x[rs1])
vmsbc.vx    vd, vs2, rs1      # Vector-scalar, no borrow-in
----

For `vmsbc`, the borrow is defined to be 1 iff the difference, prior to
truncation, is negative.

For `vadc` and `vsbc`, the instruction encoding is reserved if the
destination vector register is `v0`.

NOTE: This constraint corresponds to the constraint on masked vector
operations that overwrite the mask register.

==== Vector Bitwise Logical Instructions

----
# Bitwise logical operations.
vand.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vand.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vand.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm   # vector-immediate

vor.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm    # Vector-vector
vor.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm    # vector-scalar
vor.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm    # vector-immediate

vxor.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm    # Vector-vector
vxor.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm    # vector-scalar
vxor.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm    # vector-immediate
----

NOTE: With an immediate of -1, scalar-immediate forms of the `vxor`
instruction provide a bitwise NOT operation.  This is provided as
an assembler pseudoinstruction `vnot.v vd,vs,vm` = `vxor.vi vd,vs,-1,vm`.

==== Vector Single-Width Shift Instructions

A full set of vector shift instructions are provided, including
logical shift left (`sll`), and logical (zero-extending `srl`) and
arithmetic (sign-extending `sra`) shift right.  The data to be shifted
is in the vector register group specified by `vs2` and the shift
amount value can come from a vector register group `vs1`, a scalar
integer register `rs1`, or a zero-extended 5-bit immediate.  Only the low
lg2(SEW) bits of the shift-amount value are used to control the shift
amount.

----
# Bit shift operations
vsll.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsll.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsll.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate

vsrl.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsrl.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsrl.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate

vsra.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsra.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsra.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate
----

==== Vector Narrowing Integer Right Shift Instructions

The narrowing right shifts extract a smaller field from a wider
operand and have both zero-extending (`srl`) and sign-extending
(`sra`) forms.  The shift amount can come from a vector register
group, or a scalar `x` register, or a zero-extended 5-bit immediate.
The low lg2(2*SEW) bits of the shift-amount value are
used (e.g., the low 6 bits for a SEW=64-bit to SEW=32-bit narrowing
operation).

----
 # Narrowing shift right logical, SEW = (2*SEW) >> SEW
 vnsrl.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vector-vector
 vnsrl.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
 vnsrl.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate

 # Narrowing shift right arithmetic, SEW = (2*SEW) >> SEW
 vnsra.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vector-vector
 vnsra.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
 vnsra.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate
----

NOTE: Future extensions might add support for versions that narrow to
a destination that is 1/4 the width of the source.

NOTE: An integer value can be halved in width using the narrowing integer
shift instructions with a scalar operand of `x0`. An assembly
pseudoinstruction is provided `vncvt.x.x.w vd,vs,vm` = `vnsrl.wx vd,vs,x0,vm`.

==== Vector Integer Compare Instructions

The following integer compare instructions write 1 to the destination
mask register element if the comparison evaluates to true, and 0
otherwise.  The destination mask vector is always held in a single
vector register, with a layout of elements as described in Section
<<sec-mask-register-layout>>.  The destination mask vector register
may be the same as the source vector mask register (`v0`).

----
# Set if equal
vmseq.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vmseq.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vmseq.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm  # vector-immediate

# Set if not equal
vmsne.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vmsne.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vmsne.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm  # vector-immediate

# Set if less than, unsigned

# Set if less than or equal, unsigned
vmsleu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector

# Set if less than or equal, signed

# Set if greater than, unsigned

# Set if greater than, signed
vmsgt.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm    # Vector-scalar

# Following two instructions are not provided directly
# Set if greater than or equal, unsigned
# vmsgeu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm    # Vector-scalar
# Set if greater than or equal, signed
# vmsge.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm    # Vector-scalar
----

The following table indicates how all comparisons are implemented in
native machine code.

va, vb vector register groups
x      scalar integer register
i      immediate
----

NOTE: The immediate forms of `vmslt{u}.vi` are not provided as the
immediate value can be decreased by 1 and the `vmsle{u}.vi` variants
used instead.  The `vmsle.vi` range is -16 to 15, resulting in an
effective `vmslt.vi` range of -15 to 16.  The `vmsleu.vi` range is 0
to 15 giving an effective `vmsltu.vi` range of 1 to 16 (Note,
`vmsltu.vi` with immediate 0 is not useful as it is always
false).

NOTE: Because the 5-bit vector immediates are always sign-extended,
when the high bit of the `simm5` immediate is set, `vmsleu.vi` also
supports unsigned immediate values in the range `2^SEW^-16` to
`2^SEW^-1`, allowing corresponding `vmsltu.vi` compares against
unsigned immediates in the range `2^SEW^-15` to `2^SEW^`.  Note that
`vmsltu.vi` with immediate `2^SEW^` is not useful as it is always
true.

Similarly, `vmsge{u}.vi` is not provided and the compare is
implemented using `vmsgt{u}.vi` with the immediate decremented by one.
The resulting effective `vmsge.vi` range is -15 to 16, and the
resulting effective `vmsgeu.vi` range is 1 to 16 (Note, `vmsgeu.vi` with
immediate 0 is not useful as it is always true).

NOTE: The `vmsgt` forms for register scalar and immediates are provided
to allow a single compare instruction to provide the correct
polarity of mask value without using additional mask logical
instructions.

To reduce encoding space, the `vmsge{u}.vx` form is not directly
provided, and so the `va {ge} x` case requires special treatment.

NOTE: The `vmsge{u}.vx` could potentially be encoded in a
non-orthogonal way under the unused OPIVI variant of `vmslt{u}`.  These
would be the only instructions in OPIVI that use a scalar `x`register
however.  Alternatively, a further two funct6 encodings could be used,
but these would have a different operand format (writes to mask
register) than others in the same group of 8 funct6 encodings.  The
current PoR is to omit these instructions and to synthesize where
needed as described below.

The `vmsge{u}.vx` operation can be synthesized by reducing the
value of `x` by 1 and using the `vmsgt{u}.vx` instruction, when it is
known that this will not underflow the representation in `x`.

----
Sequences to synthesize `vmsge{u}.vx` instruction

va >= x,  x > minimum

   addi t0, x, -1; vmsgt{u}.vx vd, va, t0, vm
----

The above sequence will usually be the most efficient implementation,
but assembler pseudoinstructions can be provided for cases where the
range of `x` is unknown.

----
unmasked va >= x

  pseudoinstruction: vmsge{u}.vx vd, va, x
  expansion: vmslt{u}.vx vd, va, x; vmnand.mm vd, vd, vd

masked va >= x, vd != v0

  pseudoinstruction: vmsge{u}.vx vd, va, x, v0.t
  expansion: vmslt{u}.vx vd, va, x, v0.t; vmxor.mm vd, vd, v0

masked va >= x, vd == v0

  pseudoinstruction: vmsge{u}.vx vd, va, x, v0.t, vt
  expansion: vmslt{u}.vx vt, va, x;  vmandn.mm vd, vd, vt

masked va >= x, any vd

  pseudoinstruction: vmsge{u}.vx vd, va, x, v0.t, vt
  expansion: vmslt{u}.vx vt, va, x;  vmandn.mm vt, v0, vt;  vmandn.mm vd, vd, v0;  vmor.mm vd, vt, vd

  The vt argument to the pseudoinstruction must name a temporary vector register that is
  not same as vd and which will be clobbered by the pseudoinstruction
----

Compares effectively AND in the mask under a mask-undisturbed policy if the destination register is `v0`, e.g.,

----
# (a < b) && (b < c) in two instructions when mask-undisturbed
vmslt.vv    v0, va, vb        # All body elements written
vmslt.vv    v0, vb, vc, v0.t  # Only update at set mask
----

Compares write mask registers, and so always operate under a
tail-agnostic policy.

==== Vector Integer Min/Max Instructions

Signed and unsigned integer minimum and maximum instructions are
supported.

----
# Unsigned minimum
vminu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vminu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed minimum
vmin.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmin.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Unsigned maximum
vmaxu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmaxu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed maximum
vmax.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmax.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

==== Vector Single-Width Integer Multiply Instructions

The single-width multiply instructions perform a SEW-bit*SEW-bit
multiply to generate a 2*SEW-bit product, then return one half of the
product in the SEW-bit-wide destination.  The `*mul*` versions write
the low word of the product to the destination register, while the
`*mulh*` versions write the high word of the product to the
destination register.

----
# Signed multiply, returning low bits of product
vmul.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmul.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed multiply, returning high bits of product
vmulh.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmulh.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Unsigned multiply, returning high bits of product
vmulhu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmulhu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed(vs2)-Unsigned multiply, returning high bits of product
vmulhsu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmulhsu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

NOTE: There is no `vmulhus.vx` opcode to return high half of
unsigned-vector * signed-scalar product.  The scalar can be splatted
to a vector, then a `vmulhsu.vv` used.

NOTE: The current `vmulh*` opcodes perform simple fractional
multiplies, but with no option to scale, round, and/or saturate the
result.  A possible future extension can consider variants of `vmulh`,
`vmulhu`, `vmulhsu` that use the `vxrm` rounding mode when discarding
low half of product.  There is no possibility of overflow in these
cases.

==== Vector Integer Divide Instructions

The divide and remainder instructions are equivalent to the RISC-V
standard scalar integer multiply/divides, with the same results for
extreme inputs.

----
# Unsigned divide.
vdivu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vdivu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed divide
vdiv.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vdiv.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Unsigned remainder
vremu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vremu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed remainder
vrem.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vrem.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

NOTE: The decision to include integer divide and remainder was
contentious. The argument in favor is that without a standard
instruction, software would have to pick some algorithm to perform the
operation, which would likely perform poorly on some
microarchitectures versus others.

NOTE: There is no instruction to perform a "scalar divide by vector"
operation.

==== Vector Widening Integer Multiply Instructions

The widening integer multiply instructions return the full 2*SEW-bit
product from an SEW-bit*SEW-bit multiply.

----
# Widening signed-integer multiply
vwmul.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vector-vector
vwmul.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm # vector-scalar

# Widening unsigned-integer multiply
vwmulu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vector-vector
vwmulu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm # vector-scalar

# Widening signed(vs2)-unsigned integer multiply
vwmulsu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vector-vector
vwmulsu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm # vector-scalar
----

==== Vector Single-Width Integer Multiply-Add Instructions

The integer multiply-add instructions are destructive and are provided
in two forms, one that overwrites the addend or minuend
(`vmacc`, `vnmsac`) and one that overwrites the first multiplicand
(`vmadd`, `vnmsub`).

The low half of the product is added or subtracted from the third operand.

NOTE: `sac` is intended to be read as "subtract from accumulator". The
opcode is `vnmsac` to match the (unfortunately counterintuitive)
floating-point `fnmsub` instruction definition.  Similarly for the
`vnmsub` opcode.

----
# Integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vmacc.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vmacc.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Integer multiply-sub, overwrite minuend
vnmsac.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vnmsac.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Integer multiply-add, overwrite multiplicand
vmadd.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = (vs1[i] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]
vmadd.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = (x[rs1] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]

# Integer multiply-sub, overwrite multiplicand
vnmsub.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(vs1[i] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]
vnmsub.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(x[rs1] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]
----

==== Vector Widening Integer Multiply-Add Instructions

The widening integer multiply-add instructions add the full 2*SEW-bit
product from a SEW-bit*SEW-bit multiply to a 2*SEW-bit value and
produce a 2*SEW-bit result.  All combinations of signed and unsigned
multiply operands are supported.

----
# Widening unsigned-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmaccu.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vwmaccu.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Widening signed-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmacc.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vwmacc.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Widening signed-unsigned-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmaccsu.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = +(signed(vs1[i]) * unsigned(vs2[i])) + vd[i]
vwmaccsu.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = +(signed(x[rs1]) * unsigned(vs2[i])) + vd[i]

# Widening unsigned-signed-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmaccus.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = +(unsigned(x[rs1]) * signed(vs2[i])) + vd[i]
----

==== Vector Integer Merge Instructions

The vector integer merge instructions combine two source operands
based on a mask.  Unlike regular arithmetic instructions, the
merge operates on all body elements (i.e., the set of elements from
`vstart` up to the current vector length in `vl`).

The `vmerge` instructions are encoded as masked instructions (`vm=0`).
The instructions combine two
sources as follows.  At elements where the mask value is zero, the
first operand is copied to the destination element, otherwise the
second operand is copied to the destination element.  The first
operand is always a vector register group specified by `vs2`.  The
second operand is a vector register group specified by `vs1` or a
scalar `x` register specified by `rs1` or a 5-bit sign-extended
immediate.

----
vmerge.vvm vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # vd[i] = v0.mask[i] ? vs1[i] : vs2[i]
vmerge.vxm vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # vd[i] = v0.mask[i] ? x[rs1] : vs2[i]
vmerge.vim vd, vs2, imm, v0  # vd[i] = v0.mask[i] ? imm    : vs2[i]
----

==== Vector Integer Move Instructions

The vector integer move instructions copy a source operand to a vector
register group.
The `vmv.v.v` variant copies a vector register group, whereas the `vmv.v.x`
and `vmv.v.i` variants __splat__ a scalar register or immediate to all active
elements of the destination vector register group.
These instructions are encoded as unmasked instructions (`vm=1`).
The first operand specifier (`vs2`) must contain `v0`, and any other vector
register number in `vs2` is _reserved_.

----
vmv.v.v vd, vs1 # vd[i] = vs1[i]
vmv.v.x vd, rs1 # vd[i] = x[rs1]
vmv.v.i vd, imm # vd[i] = imm
----

NOTE: Mask values can be widened into SEW-width elements using a
sequence `vmv.v.i vd, 0; vmerge.vim vd, vd, 1, v0`.

NOTE: The vector integer move instructions share the encoding with the vector
merge instructions, but with `vm=1` and `vs2=v0`.

The form `vmv.v.v vd, vd`, which leaves body elements unchanged,
can be used to indicate that the register will next be used
with an EEW equal to SEW.

NOTE: Implementations that internally reorganize data according to EEW
can shuffle the internal representation according to SEW.
Implementations that do not internally reorganize data can dynamically
elide this instruction, and treat as a NOP.

NOTE: The `vmv.v.v vd. vd` instruction is not a RISC-V HINT as a
tail-agnostic setting may cause an architectural state change on some
implementations.

[[sec-vector-fixed-point]]
=== Vector Fixed-Point Arithmetic Instructions

The preceding set of integer arithmetic instructions is extended to support
fixed-point arithmetic.

A fixed-point number is a two's-complement signed or unsigned integer
interpreted as the numerator in a fraction with an implicit denominator.
The fixed-point instructions are intended to be applied to the numerators;
it is the responsibility of software to manage the denominators.
An N-bit element can hold two's-complement signed integers in the
range -2^N-1^...+2^N-1^-1, and unsigned integers in the range 0
... +2^N^-1.  The fixed-point instructions help preserve precision in
narrow operands by supporting scaling and rounding, and can handle
overflow by saturating results into the destination format range.

NOTE: The widening integer operations described above can also be used
to avoid overflow.

==== Vector Single-Width Saturating Add and Subtract

Saturating forms of integer add and subtract are provided, for both
signed and unsigned integers.  If the result would overflow the
destination, the result is replaced with the closest representable
value, and the `vxsat` bit is set.

----

----

==== Vector Single-Width Averaging Add and Subtract

The averaging add and subtract instructions right shift the result by
one bit and round off the result according to the setting in `vxrm`.
Both unsigned and signed versions are provided.
For `vaaddu` and `vaadd` there can be no overflow in the result.
For `vasub` and `vasubu`, overflow is ignored and the result wraps around.

NOTE: For `vasub`, overflow occurs only when subtracting the smallest number
from the largest number under `rnu` or `rne` rounding.

----
# Averaging add

# Averaging adds of unsigned integers.
vaaddu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i] + vs1[i], 1)

# Averaging adds of signed integers.

# Averaging subtract

# Averaging subtract of unsigned integers.

# Averaging subtract of signed integers.
vasub.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # roundoff_signed(vs2[i] - vs1[i], 1)
vasub.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # roundoff_signed(vs2[i] - x[rs1], 1)
----

==== Vector Single-Width Fractional Multiply with Rounding and Saturation

The signed fractional multiply instruction produces a 2*SEW product of
the two SEW inputs, then shifts the result right by SEW-1 bits,
rounding these bits according to `vxrm`, then saturates the result to
fit into SEW bits.  If the result causes saturation, the `vxsat` bit
is set.

----
# Signed saturating and rounding fractional multiply
# See vxrm  description for rounding calculation
vsmul.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i]*vs1[i], SEW-1))
vsmul.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i]*x[rs1], SEW-1))
----

NOTE: When multiplying two N-bit signed numbers, the largest magnitude
is obtained for -2^N-1^ * -2^N-1^ producing a result +2^2N-2^, which
has a single (zero) sign bit when held in 2N bits.  All other products
have two sign bits in 2N bits.  To retain greater precision in N
result bits, the product is shifted right by one bit less than N,
saturating the largest magnitude result but increasing result
precision by one bit for all other products.

NOTE: We do not provide an equivalent fractional multiply where one
input is unsigned, as these would retain all upper SEW bits and would
not need to saturate.  This operation is partly covered by the
`vmulhu` and `vmulhsu` instructions, for the case where rounding is
simply truncation (`rdn`).

==== Vector Single-Width Scaling Shift Instructions

These instructions shift the input value right, and round off the
shifted out bits according to `vxrm`.  The scaling right shifts have
both zero-extending (`vssrl`) and sign-extending (`vssra`) forms.  The
data to be shifted is in the vector register group specified by `vs2`
and the shift amount value can come from a vector register group
`vs1`, a scalar integer register `rs1`, or a zero-extended 5-bit
immediate.  Only the low lg2(SEW) bits of the shift-amount value are
used to control the shift amount.

----
 # Scaling shift right logical
 vssrl.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], vs1[i])
 vssrl.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], x[rs1])
 vssrl.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm  # vd[i] = roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], uimm)

 # Scaling shift right arithmetic
 vssra.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_signed(vs2[i],vs1[i])
 vssra.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_signed(vs2[i], x[rs1])
 vssra.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm  # vd[i] = roundoff_signed(vs2[i], uimm)
----

==== Vector Narrowing Fixed-Point Clip Instructions

The `vnclip` instructions are used to pack a fixed-point value into a
narrower destination.  The instructions support rounding, scaling, and
saturation into the final destination format.  The source data is in
the vector register group specified by `vs2`. The scaling shift amount
value can come from a vector register group `vs1`, a scalar integer
register `rs1`, or a zero-extended 5-bit immediate.  The low
lg2(2*SEW) bits of the vector or scalar shift-amount value (e.g., the
low 6 bits for a SEW=64-bit to SEW=32-bit narrowing operation) are
used to control the right shift amount, which provides the scaling.
----
# Narrowing unsigned clip
#                                SEW                            2*SEW   SEW
vnclipu.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], vs1[i]))
vnclipu.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], x[rs1]))
vnclipu.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], uimm))

# Narrowing signed clip
vnclip.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i], vs1[i]))
vnclip.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i], x[rs1]))
vnclip.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i], uimm))
----

For `vnclipu`/`vnclip`, the rounding mode is specified in the `vxrm`
CSR.  Rounding occurs around the least-significant bit of the
destination and before saturation.

For `vnclipu`, the shifted rounded source value is treated as an
unsigned integer and saturates if the result would overflow the
destination viewed as an unsigned integer.

NOTE: There is no single instruction that can saturate a signed value
into an unsigned destination.  A sequence of two vector instructions
that first removes negative numbers by performing a max against 0
using `vmax` then clips the resulting unsigned value into the
destination using `vnclipu` can be used if setting `vxsat` value for
negative numbers is not required.  A `vsetvli` is required inbetween
these two instructions to change SEW.

For `vnclip`, the shifted rounded source value is treated as a signed
integer and saturates if the result would overflow the destination viewed
as a signed integer.

If any destination element is saturated, the `vxsat` bit is set in the
`vxsat` register.

[[sec-vector-float]]
=== Vector Floating-Point Instructions

The standard vector floating-point instructions treat elements as
IEEE-754/2008-compatible values.  If the EEW of a vector
floating-point operand does not correspond to a supported IEEE
floating-point type, the instruction encoding is reserved.

NOTE: Whether floating-point is supported, and for which element
widths, is determined by the specific vector extension.  The current
set of extensions include support for 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point
values. When 16-bit and 128-bit element widths are added, they will be
also be treated as IEEE-754/2008-compatible values.  Other
floating-point formats may be supported in future extensions.

Vector floating-point instructions require the presence of base scalar
floating-point extensions corresponding to the supported vector
floating-point element widths.

NOTE: In particular, future vector extensions supporting 16-bit
half-precision floating-point values will also require some scalar
half-precision floating-point support.

If the floating-point unit status field `mstatus.FS` is `Off` then any
attempt to execute a vector floating-point instruction will raise an
illegal instruction exception.  Any vector floating-point instruction
that modifies any floating-point extension state (i.e., floating-point
CSRs or `f` registers) must set `mstatus.FS` to `Dirty`.

If the hypervisor extension is implemented and V=1, the `vsstatus.FS` field is
additionally in effect for vector floating-point instructions.  If
`vsstatus.FS` or `mstatus.FS` is `Off` then any
attempt to execute a vector floating-point instruction will raise an
illegal instruction exception.  Any vector floating-point instruction
that modifies any floating-point extension state (i.e., floating-point
CSRs or `f` registers) must set both `mstatus.FS` and `vsstatus.FS` to `Dirty`.

The vector floating-point instructions have the same behavior as the
scalar floating-point instructions with regard to NaNs.

Scalar values for floating-point vector-scalar operations are sourced
as described in Section <<sec-arithmetic-encoding>>.

==== Vector Floating-Point Exception Flags

A vector floating-point exception at any active floating-point element
sets the standard FP exception flags in the `fflags` register.  Inactive
elements do not set FP exception flags.

these would complicate microarchitectures by being the only maskable

# Floating-point reciprocal square-root estimate to 7 bits.
vfrsqrt7.v vd, vs2, vm
----

This is a unary vector-vector instruction that returns an estimate of
1/sqrt(x) accurate to 7 bits.

NOTE: An earlier draft version had used the assembler name `vfrsqrte7`
but this was deemed to cause confusion with the ``e``__x__ notation for element
width.  The earlier name can be retained as alias in tool chains for
backward compatibility.

The following table describes the instruction's behavior for all
classes of floating-point inputs:

[cols="1,1,1"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",options="header"]
|===
| Input | Output | Exceptions raised

| -{inf} {le} _x_ < -0.0     | canonical NaN           | NV
| -0.0                       | -{inf}                  | DZ

| sNaN                       | canonical NaN           | NV
|===

NOTE: All positive normal and subnormal inputs produce normal outputs.

NOTE: The output value is independent of the dynamic rounding mode.

For the non-exceptional cases, the low bit of the exponent and the six high
bits of significand (after the leading one) are concatenated and used to
address the following table.
The output of the table becomes the seven high bits of the result significand
(after the leading one); the remainder of the result significand is zero.
Subnormal inputs are normalized and the exponent adjusted appropriately before
the lookup.
The output exponent is chosen to make the result approximate the reciprocal of
the square root of the argument.

More precisely, the result is computed as follows.
Let the normalized input exponent be equal to the input exponent if the input
is normal, or 0 minus the number of leading zeros in the significand
otherwise.
If the input is subnormal, the normalized input significand is given by
shifting the input significand left by 1 minus the normalized input exponent,
discarding the leading 1 bit.
The output exponent equals floor((3*B - 1 - the normalized input exponent) / 2),
where B is the exponent bias. The output sign equals the input sign.

The following table gives the seven MSBs of the output significand as a
function of the LSB of the normalized input exponent and the six MSBs of the
normalized input significand; the other bits of the output significand are zero.

include::images/wavedrom/vfrsqrt7.edn[]

NOTE: For example, when SEW=32, vfrsqrt7(0x00718abc ({approx} 1.043e-38)) = 0x5f080000 ({approx} 9.800e18), and vfrsqrt7(0x7f765432 ({approx} 3.274e38)) = 0x1f820000 ({approx} 5.506e-20).

NOTE: The 7 bit accuracy was chosen as it requires 0,1,2,3
Newton-Raphson iterations to converge to close to bfloat16, FP16,
FP32, FP64 accuracy respectively.   Future instructions can be defined
with greater estimate accuracy.

NOTE: Subnormal inputs with magnitude at least 2^-(B+1)^ produce normal outputs;
other subnormal inputs produce infinite outputs.
Normal inputs with magnitude at least 2^B-1^ produce subnormal outputs;
other normal inputs produce normal outputs.

NOTE: The output value depends on the dynamic rounding mode when
the overflow exception is raised.

For the non-exceptional cases, the seven high bits of significand (after the
leading one) are used to address the following table.
The output of the table becomes the seven high bits of the result significand
(after the leading one); the remainder of the result significand is zero.
Subnormal inputs are normalized and the exponent adjusted appropriately before
the lookup.
The output exponent is chosen to make the result approximate the reciprocal of
the argument, and subnormal outputs are denormalized accordingly.

More precisely, the result is computed as follows.
Let the normalized input exponent be equal to the input exponent if the input
is normal, or 0 minus the number of leading zeros in the significand
otherwise.
The normalized output exponent equals (2*B - 1 - the normalized input exponent).
If the normalized output exponent is outside the range [-1, 2*B], the result
corresponds to one of the exceptional cases in the table above.

If the input is subnormal, the normalized input significand is given by
shifting the input significand left by 1 minus the normalized input exponent,
discarding the leading 1 bit.
Otherwise, the normalized input significand equals the input significand.
The following table gives the seven MSBs of the normalized output significand
as a function of the seven MSBs of the normalized input significand; the other
bits of the normalized output significand are zero.

include::images/wavedrom/vfrec7.edn[]

If the normalized output exponent is 0 or -1, the result is subnormal: the
output exponent is 0, and the output significand is given by concatenating
a 1 bit to the left of the normalized output significand, then shifting that
quantity right by 1 minus the normalized output exponent.
Otherwise, the output exponent equals the normalized output exponent, and the
output significand equals the normalized output significand.
The output sign equals the input sign.

NOTE: For example, when SEW=32, vfrec7(0x00718abc ({approx} 1.043e-38)) = 0x7e900000 ({approx} 9.570e37), and vfrec7(0x7f765432 ({approx} 3.274e38)) = 0x00214000 ({approx} 3.053e-39).

NOTE: The 7 bit accuracy was chosen as it requires 0,1,2,3
Newton-Raphson iterations to converge to close to bfloat16, FP16,
FP32, FP64 accuracy respectively.   Future instructions can be defined
with greater estimate accuracy.

==== Vector Floating-Point MIN/MAX Instructions

The vector floating-point `vfmin` and `vfmax` instructions have the
same behavior as the corresponding scalar floating-point instructions
in version 2.2 of the RISC-V F/D/Q extension: they perform the `minimumNumber`
or `maximumNumber` operation on active elements.

----
# Floating-point minimum
vfmin.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vfmin.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Floating-point maximum
vfmax.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vfmax.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

==== Vector Floating-Point Sign-Injection Instructions

Vector versions of the scalar sign-injection instructions.  The result
takes all bits except the sign bit from the vector `vs2` operands.

----
vfsgnj.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vfsgnj.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

vfsgnjn.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vfsgnjn.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

vfsgnjx.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vfsgnjx.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
----

NOTE: A vector of floating-point values can be negated using a
sign-injection instruction with both source operands set to the same
vector operand.  An assembly pseudoinstruction is provided: `vfneg.v vd,vs` = `vfsgnjn.vv vd,vs,vs`.

NOTE: The absolute value of a vector of floating-point elements can be
calculated using a sign-injection instruction with both source
operands set to the same vector operand.  An assembly
pseudoinstruction is provided: `vfabs.v vd,vs` = `vfsgnjx.vv vd,vs,vs`.

==== Vector Floating-Point Compare Instructions

These vector FP compare instructions compare two source operands and
write the comparison result to a mask register.  The destination mask
vector is always held in a single vector register, with a layout of
elements as described in Section <<sec-mask-register-layout>>.  The
destination mask vector register may be the same as the source vector
mask register (`v0`).  Compares write mask registers, and so always
operate under a tail-agnostic policy.

The compare instructions follow the semantics of the scalar
floating-point compare instructions.  `vmfeq` and `vmfne` raise the invalid
operation exception only on signaling NaN inputs.  `vmflt`, `vmfle`, `vmfgt`,
and `vmfge` raise the invalid operation exception on both signaling and
quiet NaN inputs.
`vmfne` writes 1 to the destination element when either
operand is NaN, whereas the other compares write 0 when either operand
is NaN.

----
# Compare equal
vmfeq.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vmfeq.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Compare not equal
vmfne.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vmfne.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Compare less than
vmflt.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vmflt.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Compare less than or equal
vmfle.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
vmfle.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Compare greater than
vmfgt.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Compare greater than or equal
vmfge.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

----

NOTE: Providing all forms is necessary to correctly handle unordered
compares for NaNs.

NOTE: C99 floating-point quiet compares can be implemented by masking
the signaling compares when either input is NaN, as follows.  When
the comparand is a non-NaN constant, the middle two instructions can be
omitted.

----
# Example of implementing isgreater()
vmfeq.vv v0, va, va        # Only set where A is not NaN.
vmfeq.vv v1, vb, vb        # Only set where B is not NaN.
vmand.mm v0, v0, v1        # Only set where A and B are ordered,
vmfgt.vv v0, va, vb, v0.t  #  so only set flags on ordered values.
----

NOTE: In the above sequence, it is tempting to mask the second `vmfeq`
instruction and remove the `vmand` instruction, but this more efficient
sequence incorrectly fails to raise the invalid exception when an
element of `va` contains a quiet NaN and the corresponding element in
`vb` contains a signaling NaN.

==== Vector Floating-Point Classify Instruction

This is a unary vector-vector instruction that operates in the same
way as the scalar classify instruction.

----
vfclass.v vd, vs2, vm   # Vector-vector
----

The 10-bit mask produced by this instruction is placed in the
least-significant bits of the result elements.  The upper (SEW-10)
bits of the result are filled with zeros. The instruction is only
defined for SEW=16b and above, so the result will always fit in the
destination elements.

==== Vector Floating-Point Merge Instruction

A vector-scalar floating-point merge instruction is provided, which
operates on all body elements from `vstart` up to the current vector
length in `vl` regardless of mask value.

The `vfmerge.vfm` instruction is encoded as a masked instruction (`vm=0`).
At elements where the mask value is zero, the first vector operand is
copied to the destination element, otherwise a scalar floating-point
register value is copied to the destination element.

----
vfmerge.vfm vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # vd[i] = v0.mask[i] ? f[rs1] : vs2[i]
----

[[sec-vector-float-move]]
==== Vector Floating-Point Move Instruction

The vector floating-point move instruction __splats__ a floating-point
scalar operand to a vector register group.  The instruction copies a
scalar `f` register value to all active elements of a vector register
group.  This instruction is encoded as an unmasked instruction (`vm=1`).
The instruction must have the `vs2` field set to `v0`, with all other
values for `vs2` reserved.

----
vfmv.v.f vd, rs1  # vd[i] = f[rs1]
----

NOTE: The `vfmv.v.f` instruction shares the encoding with the `vfmerge.vfm`
instruction, but with `vm=1` and `vs2=v0`.

==== Single-Width Floating-Point/Integer Type-Convert Instructions

Conversion operations are provided to convert to and from
floating-point values and unsigned and signed integers, where both
source and destination are SEW wide.

----
vfcvt.xu.f.v vd, vs2, vm       # Convert float to unsigned integer.
vfcvt.x.f.v  vd, vs2, vm       # Convert float to signed integer.

vfcvt.rtz.xu.f.v vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to unsigned integer, truncating.
vfcvt.rtz.x.f.v  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to signed integer, truncating.

vfcvt.f.xu.v vd, vs2, vm       # Convert unsigned integer to float.
vfcvt.f.x.v  vd, vs2, vm       # Convert signed integer to float.
----

The conversions follow the same rules on exceptional conditions as the
scalar conversion instructions.
The conversions use the dynamic rounding mode in `frm`, except for the `rtz`
variants, which round towards zero.

NOTE: The `rtz` variants are provided to accelerate truncating conversions
from floating-point to integer, as is common in languages like C and Java.

==== Widening Floating-Point/Integer Type-Convert Instructions

A set of conversion instructions is provided to convert between
narrower integer and floating-point datatypes to a type of twice the
width.

----
vfwcvt.xu.f.v vd, vs2, vm       # Convert float to double-width unsigned integer.
vfwcvt.x.f.v  vd, vs2, vm       # Convert float to double-width signed integer.

vfwcvt.rtz.xu.f.v vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to double-width unsigned integer, truncating.
vfwcvt.rtz.x.f.v  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to double-width signed integer, truncating.

vfwcvt.f.xu.v vd, vs2, vm       # Convert unsigned integer to double-width float.
vfwcvt.f.x.v  vd, vs2, vm       # Convert signed integer to double-width float.

vfwcvt.f.f.v vd, vs2, vm        # Convert single-width float to double-width float.
----

These instructions have the same constraints on vector register overlap
as other widening instructions (see <<sec-widening>>).

NOTE: A double-width IEEE floating-point value can always represent a
single-width integer exactly.

NOTE: A double-width IEEE floating-point value can always represent a
single-width IEEE floating-point value exactly.

NOTE: A full set of floating-point widening conversions is not
supported as single instructions, but any widening conversion can be
implemented as several doubling steps with equivalent results and no
additional exception flags raised.

==== Narrowing Floating-Point/Integer Type-Convert Instructions

A set of conversion instructions is provided to convert wider integer
and floating-point datatypes to a type of half the width.

----
vfncvt.xu.f.w vd, vs2, vm       # Convert double-width float to unsigned integer.
vfncvt.x.f.w  vd, vs2, vm       # Convert double-width float to signed integer.

vfncvt.rtz.xu.f.w vd, vs2, vm   # Convert double-width float to unsigned integer, truncating.
vfncvt.rtz.x.f.w  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert double-width float to signed integer, truncating.

vfncvt.f.xu.w vd, vs2, vm       # Convert double-width unsigned integer to float.
vfncvt.f.x.w  vd, vs2, vm       # Convert double-width signed integer to float.

vfncvt.f.f.w vd, vs2, vm        # Convert double-width float to single-width float.
vfncvt.rod.f.f.w vd, vs2, vm    # Convert double-width float to single-width float,
                                #  rounding towards odd.
----

These instructions have the same constraints on vector register overlap
as other narrowing instructions (see <<sec-narrowing>>).

NOTE: A full set of floating-point narrowing conversions is not
supported as single instructions. Conversions can be implemented in
a sequence of halving steps.  Results are equivalently rounded and
the same exception flags are raised if all but the last halving step
use round-towards-odd (`vfncvt.rod.f.f.w`).  Only the final step
should use the desired rounding mode.

NOTE: For `vfncvt.rod.f.f.w`, a finite value that exceeds the range of the
destination format is converted to the destination format's largest finite value with the same sign.

=== Vector Reduction Operations

Vector reduction operations take a vector register group of elements
and a scalar held in element 0 of a vector register, and perform a
reduction using some binary operator, to produce a scalar result in
element 0 of a vector register.  The scalar input and output operands
are held in element 0 of a single vector register, not a vector
register group, so any vector register can be the scalar source or
destination of a vector reduction regardless of LMUL setting.

The destination vector register can overlap the source operands,
including the mask register.

NOTE: Vector reductions read and write the scalar operand and result
into element 0 of a vector register instead of a scalar register to
avoid a loss of decoupling with the scalar processor, and to support
future polymorphic use with future types not supported in the scalar
unit.

Inactive elements from the source vector register group are excluded
from the reduction, but the scalar operand is always included
regardless of the mask values.

The other elements in the destination vector register ( 0 < index <
VLEN/SEW) are considered the tail and are managed with the current
tail agnostic/undisturbed policy.

If `vl`=0, no operation is performed and the destination register is
not updated.

NOTE: This choice of behavior for `vl`=0 reduces implementation
complexity as it is consistent with other operations on vector
register state.  For the common case that the source and destination
scalar operand are the same vector register, this behavior also
produces the expected result.  For the uncommon case that the source
and destination scalar operand are in different vector registers, this
instruction will not copy the source into the destination when `vl`=0.
However, it is expected that in most of these cases it will be
statically known that `vl` is not zero.  In other cases, a check for
`vl`=0 will have to be added to ensure that the source scalar is
copied to the destination (e.g., by explicitly setting `vl`=1 and
performing a register-register copy).

Traps on vector reduction instructions are always reported with a
`vstart` of 0.  Vector reduction operations raise an illegal
instruction exception if `vstart` is non-zero.

The assembler syntax for a reduction operation is `vredop.vs`, where
the `.vs` suffix denotes the first operand is a vector register group
and the second operand is a scalar stored in element 0 of a vector
register.

[[sec-vector-integer-reduce]]
==== Vector Single-Width Integer Reduction Instructions

All operands and results of single-width reduction instructions have
the same SEW width.  Overflows wrap around on arithmetic sums.

----
# Simple reductions, where [*] denotes all active elements:
vredsum.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =  sum( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
vredmaxu.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] = maxu( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )

vredxor.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =  xor( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
----

[[sec-vector-integer-reduce-widen]]
==== Vector Widening Integer Reduction Instructions

The unsigned `vwredsumu.vs` instruction zero-extends the SEW-wide
vector elements before summing them, then adds the 2*SEW-width scalar
element, and stores the result in a 2*SEW-width scalar element.

The `vwredsum.vs` instruction sign-extends the SEW-wide vector
elements before summing them.

For both `vwredsumu.vs` and `vwredsum.vs`, overflows wrap around.

----
# Unsigned sum reduction into double-width accumulator
vwredsumu.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # 2*SEW = 2*SEW + sum(zero-extend(SEW))

# Signed sum reduction into double-width accumulator
vwredsum.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # 2*SEW = 2*SEW + sum(sign-extend(SEW))

vfredusum.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Unordered sum

----

NOTE: Older assembler mnemonic `vfredsum` is retained as alias for `vfredusum`.

===== Vector Ordered Single-Width Floating-Point Sum Reduction

The `vfredosum` instruction must sum the floating-point values in
element order, starting with the scalar in `vs1[0]`--that is, it
performs the computation:

----
 vd[0] = `(((vs1[0] + vs2[0]) + vs2[1]) + ...) + vs2[vl-1]`
----
where each addition operates identically to the scalar floating-point
instructions in terms of raising exception flags and generating or
propagating special values.

NOTE: The ordered reduction supports compiler autovectorization, while
the unordered FP sum allows for faster implementations.

When the operation is masked (`vm=0`), the masked-off elements do not
affect the result or the exception flags.

NOTE: If no elements are active, no additions are performed, so the scalar in
`vs1[0]` is simply copied to the destination register, without canonicalizing
NaN values and without setting any exception flags.  This behavior preserves
the handling of NaNs, exceptions, and rounding when autovectorizing a scalar
summation loop.

===== Vector Unordered Single-Width Floating-Point Sum Reduction

The unordered sum reduction instruction, `vfredusum`, provides an
implementation more freedom in performing the reduction.

The implementation must produce a result equivalent to a reduction tree
composed of binary operator nodes, with the inputs being elements from
the source vector register group (`vs2`) and the source scalar value
(`vs1[0]`).  Each operator in the tree accepts two inputs and produces
one result.
Each operator first computes an exact sum as a RISC-V scalar floating-point
addition with infinite exponent range and precision, then converts this exact
sum to a floating-point format with range and precision each at least as great
as the element floating-point format indicated by SEW, rounding using the
currently active floating-point dynamic rounding mode and raising exception
flags as necessary.
A different floating-point range and precision may be chosen for the result of
each operator.
A node where one input is derived only from elements masked-off or beyond the
active vector length may either treat that input as the additive identity of the
appropriate EEW or simply copy the other input to its output.
The rounded result from the root node in the tree is converted (rounded again,
using the dynamic rounding mode) to the standard floating-point format
indicated by SEW.
An implementation
is allowed to add an additional additive identity to the final result.

The additive identity is +0.0 when rounding down (towards -{inf}) or
-0.0 for all other rounding modes.

The reduction tree structure must be deterministic for a given value
in `vtype` and `vl`.

NOTE: As a consequence of this definition, implementations need not propagate
NaN payloads through the reduction tree when no elements are active. In
particular, if no elements are active and the scalar input is NaN,
implementations are permitted to canonicalize the NaN and, if the NaN is
signaling, set the invalid exception flag.  Implementations are alternatively
permitted to pass through the original NaN and set no exception flags, as with
`vfredosum`.

NOTE: The `vfredosum` instruction is a valid implementation of the
`vfredusum` instruction.

===== Vector Single-Width Floating-Point Max and Min Reductions

The `vfredmin` and `vfredmax` instructions reduce the scalar argument in
`vs1[0]` and active elements in `vs2` using the `minimumNumber` and
`maximumNumber` operations, respectively.

NOTE: Floating-point max and min reductions should return the same
final value and raise the same exception flags regardless of operation
order.

NOTE: If no elements are active, the scalar in `vs1[0]` is simply copied to
the destination register, without canonicalizing NaN values and without
setting any exception flags.

[[sec-vector-float-reduce-widen]]
==== Vector Widening Floating-Point Reduction Instructions

Widening forms of the sum reductions are provided that
read and write a double-width reduction result.

----
 # Simple reductions.
 vfwredosum.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Ordered sum
 vfwredusum.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Unordered sum
----

NOTE: Older assembler mnemonic `vfwredsum` is retained as alias for `vfwredusum`.

The reduction of the SEW-width elements is performed as in the
single-width reduction case, with the elements in `vs2` promoted
to 2*SEW bits before adding to the 2*SEW-bit accumulator.

NOTE: `vfwredosum.vs` handles inactive elements and NaN payloads analogously
to `vfredosum.vs`; `vfwredusum.vs` does so analogously to `vfredusum.vs`.

[[sec-vector-mask]]
=== Vector Mask Instructions

Several instructions are provided to help operate on mask values held in
a vector register.

[[sec-mask-register-logical]]
==== Vector Mask-Register Logical Instructions

Vector mask-register logical operations operate on mask registers.
Each element in a mask register is a single bit, so these instructions
all operate on single vector registers regardless of the setting of
the `vlmul` field in `vtype`.  They do not change the value of
`vlmul`.  The destination vector register may be the same as either
source vector register.

As with other vector instructions, the elements with indices less than
`vstart` are unchanged, and `vstart` is reset to zero after execution.
Vector mask logical instructions are always unmasked, so there are no
inactive elements, and the encodings with `vm=0` are reserved.
Mask elements past `vl`, the tail elements, are
always updated with a tail-agnostic policy.

----
vmand.mm vd, vs2, vs1   # vd.mask[i] =   vs2.mask[i] &&  vs1.mask[i]
vmnand.mm vd, vs2, vs1  # vd.mask[i] = !(vs2.mask[i] &&  vs1.mask[i])
vmandn.mm vd, vs2, vs1  # vd.mask[i] =   vs2.mask[i] && !vs1.mask[i]
vmxor.mm  vd, vs2, vs1  # vd.mask[i] =   vs2.mask[i] ^^  vs1.mask[i]
vmor.mm  vd, vs2, vs1   # vd.mask[i] =   vs2.mask[i] ||  vs1.mask[i]
vmnor.mm  vd, vs2, vs1  # vd.mask[i] = !(vs2.mask[i] ||  vs1.mask[i])
vmorn.mm  vd, vs2, vs1  # vd.mask[i] =   vs2.mask[i] || !vs1.mask[i]
vmxnor.mm vd, vs2, vs1  # vd.mask[i] = !(vs2.mask[i] ^^  vs1.mask[i])
----

NOTE: The previous assembler mnemonics `vmandnot` and `vmornot` have
been changed to `vmandn` and `vmorn` to be consistent with the
equivalent scalar instructions.  The old `vmandnot` and `vmornot`
mnemonics can be retained as assembler aliases for compatibility.

Several assembler pseudoinstructions are defined as shorthand for
common uses of mask logical operations:
----
vmmv.m vd, vs  => vmand.mm vd, vs, vs   # Copy mask register
vmclr.m vd     => vmxor.mm vd, vd, vd   # Clear mask register
vmset.m vd     => vmxnor.mm vd, vd, vd  # Set mask register
vmnot.m vd, vs => vmnand.mm vd, vs, vs  # Invert bits
----

NOTE: The `vmmv.m` instruction was previously called `vmcpy.m`, but
with new layout it is more consistent to name as a "mv" because bits
are copied without interpretation.  The `vmcpy.m` assembler
pseudoinstruction can be retained for compatibility.  For
implementations that internally rearrange bits according to EEW, a
`vmmv.m` instruction with same source and destination can be used as
idiom to force an internal reformat into a mask vector.

The set of eight mask logical instructions can generate any of the 16
possibly binary logical functions of the two input masks:

|===

NOTE: The vector mask logical instructions are designed to be easily
fused with a following masked vector operation to effectively expand
the number of predicate registers by moving values into `v0` before
use.


==== Vector count population in mask `vcpop.m`

----
vcpop.m rd, vs2, vm
----

NOTE: This instruction previously had the assembler mnemonic `vpopc.m`
but was renamed to be consistent with the scalar instruction.  The
assembler instruction alias `vpopc.m` is being retained for software
compatibility.

The source operand is a single vector register holding mask register
values as described in Section <<sec-mask-register-layout>>.

The `vcpop.m` instruction counts the number of mask elements of the
active elements of the vector source mask register that have the value
1 and writes the result to a scalar `x` register.

The operation can be performed under a mask, in which case only the
masked elements are counted.

----
vcpop.m rd, vs2, v0.t # x[rd] = sum_i ( vs2.mask[i] && v0.mask[i] )
----

The `vcpop.m` instruction writes `x[rd]` even if `vl`=0 (with the
value 0, since no mask elements are active).

Traps on `vcpop.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vcpop.m` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

==== `vfirst` find-first-set mask bit

----
vfirst.m rd, vs2, vm
----

The `vfirst` instruction finds the lowest-numbered active element of
the source mask vector that has the value 1 and writes that element's
index to a GPR.  If no active element has the value 1, -1 is written
to the GPR.

NOTE: Software can assume that any negative value (highest bit set)
corresponds to no element found, as vector lengths will never reach
2^(XLEN-1)^ on any implementation.

The `vfirst.m` instruction writes `x[rd]` even if `vl`=0 (with the
value -1, since no mask elements are active).

Traps on `vfirst` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vfirst` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

==== `vmsbf.m` set-before-first mask bit

----
    vmsbf.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsbf.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1   v2 contents

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1   v3 contents
                       vmsbf.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   v2

     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsbf.m v2, v3
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   v2

     1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1   v0 vcontents
     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsbf.m v2, v3, v0.t
     0 1 x x x x 1 1   v2 contents
----

The `vmsbf.m` instruction takes a mask register as input and writes
results to a mask register.  The instruction writes a 1 to all active
mask elements before the first active source element that is a 1, then
writes a 0 to that element and all following active elements.  If
there is no set bit in the active elements of the source vector, then
all active elements in the destination are written with a 1.

The tail elements in the destination mask register are updated under a
tail-agnostic policy.

Traps on `vmsbf.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vmsbf` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

The destination register cannot overlap the source register
and, if masked, cannot overlap the mask register ('v0').

==== `vmsif.m` set-including-first mask bit

The vector mask set-including-first instruction is similar to
set-before-first, except it also includes the element with a set bit.

----
    vmsif.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsif.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1   v2 contents

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1   v3 contents
                       vmsif.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   v2

     1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1   v0 vcontents
     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsif.m v2, v3, v0.t
     1 1 x x x x 1 1   v2 contents
----

The tail elements in the destination mask register are updated under a
tail-agnostic policy.

Traps on `vmsif.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vmsif` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

The destination register cannot overlap the source register
and, if masked, cannot overlap the mask register ('v0').

==== `vmsof.m` set-only-first mask bit

The vector mask set-only-first instruction is similar to
set-before-first, except it only sets the first element with a bit
set, if any.

----
    vmsof.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsof.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0   v2 contents

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1   v3 contents
                       vmsof.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   v2

     1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1   v0 vcontents
     1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsof.m v2, v3, v0.t
     0 1 x x x x 0 0   v2 contents
----

The tail elements in the destination mask register are updated under a
tail-agnostic policy.

Traps on `vmsof.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vmsof` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

The destination register cannot overlap the source register
and, if masked, cannot overlap the mask register ('v0').

==== Example using vector mask instructions

The following is an example of vectorizing a data-dependent exit loop.

----
include::example/strcpy.s[lines=4..-1]
----
----
include::example/strncpy.s[lines=4..-1]
----

==== Vector Iota Instruction

The `viota.m` instruction reads a source vector mask register and
writes to each element of the destination vector register group the
sum of all the bits of elements in the mask register
whose index is less than the element, e.g., a parallel prefix sum of
the mask values.

This instruction can be masked, in which case only the enabled
elements contribute to the sum.

----
 viota.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   v2 contents
                       viota.m v4, v2 # Unmasked
     2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0   v4 result

     1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1   v0 contents
     1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   v2 contents
     2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   v4 contents
                       viota.m v4, v2, v0.t # Masked, vtype.vma=0
     1 1 1 5 1 7 1 0   v4 results
----

The result value is zero-extended to fill the destination element if
SEW is wider than the result.  If the result value would overflow the
destination SEW, the least-significant SEW bits are retained.

Traps on `viota.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0, and
execution is always restarted from the beginning when resuming after a
trap handler.  An illegal instruction exception is raised if `vstart`
is non-zero.

The destination register group cannot overlap the source register
and, if masked, cannot overlap the mask register (`v0`).

The `viota.m` instruction can be combined with memory scatter
instructions (indexed stores) to perform vector compress functions.

      mv a0, a6                    # Return count
      ret
----

==== Vector Element Index Instruction

The `vid.v` instruction writes each element's index to the
destination vector register group, from 0 to `vl`-1.

----
vid.v vd, vm  # Write element ID to destination.
----

The instruction can be masked.  Masking does not change the
index value written to active elements.

The `vs2` field of the instruction must be set to `v0`, otherwise the
encoding is _reserved_.

The result value is zero-extended to fill the destination element if
SEW is wider than the result.  If the result value would overflow the
destination SEW, the least-significant SEW bits are retained.

NOTE: Microarchitectures can implement `vid.v` instruction using the
same datapath as `viota.m` but with an implicit set mask source.

[[sec-vector-permute]]
=== Vector Permutation Instructions

A range of permutation instructions are provided to move elements
around within the vector registers.

==== Integer Scalar Move Instructions

The integer scalar read/write instructions transfer a single
value between a scalar `x` register and element 0 of a vector
register.  The instructions ignore LMUL and vector register groups.

----
vmv.x.s rd, vs2  # x[rd] = vs2[0] (vs1=0)
vmv.s.x vd, rs1  # vd[0] = x[rs1] (vs2=0)
----

The `vmv.x.s` instruction copies a single SEW-wide element from index 0 of the
source vector register to a destination integer register.  If SEW > XLEN, the
least-significant XLEN bits are transferred and the upper SEW-XLEN bits are
ignored.  If SEW < XLEN, the value is sign-extended to XLEN bits.

NOTE: `vmv.x.s` performs its operation even if `vstart` {ge} `vl` or `vl`=0.

The `vmv.s.x` instruction copies the scalar integer register to element 0 of
the destination vector register.  If SEW < XLEN, the least-significant bits
are copied and the upper XLEN-SEW bits are ignored.  If SEW > XLEN, the value
is sign-extended to SEW bits.  The other elements in the destination vector
register ( 0 < index < VLEN/SEW) are treated as tail elements using the current tail agnostic/undisturbed policy.  If `vstart` {ge} `vl`, no
operation is performed and the destination register is not updated.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements are updated in the
destination vector register group, regardless of `vstart`.

The encodings corresponding to the masked versions (`vm=0`) of `vmv.x.s`
and `vmv.s.x` are reserved.

==== Floating-Point Scalar Move Instructions

The floating-point scalar read/write instructions transfer a single
value between a scalar `f` register and element 0 of a vector
register.  The instructions ignore LMUL and vector register groups.

----
vfmv.f.s rd, vs2  # f[rd] = vs2[0] (rs1=0)
vfmv.s.f vd, rs1  # vd[0] = f[rs1] (vs2=0)
----

The `vfmv.f.s` instruction copies a single SEW-wide element from index
0 of the source vector register to a destination scalar floating-point
register.

NOTE: `vfmv.f.s` performs its operation even if `vstart` {ge} `vl` or `vl`=0.

The `vfmv.s.f` instruction copies the scalar floating-point register
to element 0 of the destination vector register.  The other elements
in the destination vector register ( 0 < index < VLEN/SEW) are treated
as tail elements using the current tail agnostic/undisturbed policy.
If `vstart` {ge} `vl`, no operation is performed and the destination
register is not updated.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements are updated in the
destination vector register group, regardless of `vstart`.

The encodings corresponding to the masked versions (`vm=0`) of `vfmv.f.s`
and `vfmv.s.f` are reserved.

==== Vector Slide Instructions

The slide instructions move elements up and down a vector register
group.

NOTE: The slide operations can be implemented much more efficiently
than using the arbitrary register gather instruction.  Implementations
may optimize certain OFFSET values for `vslideup` and `vslidedown`.
In particular, power-of-2 offsets may operate substantially faster
than other offsets.

For all of the `vslideup`, `vslidedown`, `v[f]slide1up`, and
`v[f]slide1down` instructions, if `vstart` {ge} `vl`, the instruction performs no
operation and leaves the destination vector register unchanged.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements are updated in the
destination vector register group, regardless of `vstart`.

The tail agnostic/undisturbed policy is followed for tail elements.

The slide instructions may be masked, with mask element _i_
controlling whether _destination_ element _i_ is written.  The mask
undisturbed/agnostic policy is followed for inactive elements.

===== Vector Slideup Instructions

----
vslideup.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm        # vd[i+x[rs1]] = vs2[i]
vslideup.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm       # vd[i+uimm] = vs2[i]
----

For `vslideup`, the value in `vl` specifies the maximum number of destination
elements that are written.  The start index (_OFFSET_) for the
destination can be either specified using an unsigned integer in the
`x` register specified by `rs1`, or a 5-bit immediate, zero-extended to XLEN bits.
If XLEN > SEW, _OFFSET_ is _not_ truncated to SEW bits.
Destination elements _OFFSET_ through `vl`-1 are written if unmasked and
if _OFFSET_ < `vl`.

----
vslideup behavior for destination elements (`vstart` < `vl`)

OFFSET is amount to slideup, either from x register or a 5-bit immediate

                  0 <= i < min(vl, max(vstart, OFFSET))  Unchanged
max(vstart, OFFSET) <= i < vl                            vd[i] = vs2[i-OFFSET] if v0.mask[i] enabled
                 vl <= i < VLMAX                         Follow tail policy
----

The destination vector register group for `vslideup` cannot overlap
the source vector register group, otherwise the instruction encoding
is reserved.

NOTE: The non-overlap constraint avoids WAR hazards on the
input vectors during execution, and enables restart with non-zero
`vstart`.

===== Vector Slidedown Instructions

----
vslidedown.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm       # vd[i] = vs2[i+x[rs1]]
vslidedown.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm      # vd[i] = vs2[i+uimm]
----

For `vslidedown`, the value in `vl` specifies the maximum number of
destination elements that are written.  The remaining elements past
`vl` are handled according to the current tail policy (Section
<<sec-agnostic>>).

The start index (_OFFSET_) for the source can be either specified
using an unsigned integer in the `x` register specified by `rs1`, or a
5-bit immediate, zero-extended to XLEN bits.
If XLEN > SEW, _OFFSET_ is _not_ truncated to SEW bits.

----
vslidedown behavior for source elements for element i in slide (`vstart` < `vl`)
                0 <= i+OFFSET < VLMAX   src[i] = vs2[i+OFFSET]
            VLMAX <= i+OFFSET           src[i] = 0

vslidedown behavior for destination element i in slide (`vstart` < `vl`)
                 0 <= i < vstart         Unchanged
            vstart <= i < vl             vd[i] = src[i] if v0.mask[i] enabled
                vl <= i < VLMAX          Follow tail policy
----

===== Vector Slide1up

Variants of slide are provided that only move by one element but which
also allow a scalar integer value to be inserted at the vacated
element position.

----
vslide1up.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm        # vd[0]=x[rs1], vd[i+1] = vs2[i]
----

The `vslide1up` instruction places the `x` register argument at
location 0 of the destination vector register group, provided that
element 0 is active, otherwise the destination element update follows the
current mask agnostic/undisturbed policy.  If XLEN < SEW, the value is
sign-extended to SEW bits.  If XLEN > SEW, the least-significant bits
are copied over and the high XLEN-SEW bits are ignored.

The remaining active `vl`-1 elements are copied over from index _i_ in
the source vector register group to index _i_+1 in the destination
vector register group.

The `vl` register specifies the maximum number of destination vector
register elements updated with source values, and remaining elements
past `vl` are handled according to the current tail policy (Section
<<sec-agnostic>>).


----
vslide1up behavior when vl > 0

                  i < vstart  unchanged
              0 = i = vstart  vd[i] = x[rs1] if v0.mask[i] enabled
max(vstart, 1) <= i < vl      vd[i] = vs2[i-1] if v0.mask[i] enabled
            vl <= i < VLMAX   Follow tail policy
----

The `vslide1up` instruction requires that the destination vector
register group does not overlap the source vector register group.
Otherwise, the instruction encoding is reserved.

[[sec-vfslide1up]]
===== Vector Floating-Point Slide1up Instruction

----
vfslide1up.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm        # vd[0]=f[rs1], vd[i+1] = vs2[i]
----

The `vfslide1up` instruction is defined analogously to `vslide1up`,
but sources its scalar argument from an `f` register.

===== Vector Slide1down Instruction

The `vslide1down` instruction copies the first `vl`-1 active elements
values from index _i_+1 in the source vector register group to index
_i_ in the destination vector register group.

The `vl` register specifies the maximum number of destination vector
register elements written with source values, and remaining elements
past `vl` are handled according to the current tail policy (Section
<<sec-agnostic>>).

----
vslide1down.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm      # vd[i] = vs2[i+1], vd[vl-1]=x[rs1]
----

The `vslide1down` instruction places the `x` register argument at
location `vl`-1 in the destination vector register, provided that
element `vl-1` is active, otherwise the destination element update
follows the current mask agnostic/undisturbed policy.
If XLEN < SEW, the value is sign-extended to SEW bits.  If
XLEN > SEW, the least-significant bits are copied over and the high
SEW-XLEN bits are ignored.

----
vslide1down behavior

          i < vstart  unchanged
vstart <= i < vl-1    vd[i] = vs2[i+1] if v0.mask[i] enabled
vstart <= i = vl-1    vd[vl-1] = x[rs1] if v0.mask[i] enabled
    vl <= i < VLMAX   Follow tail policy
----

NOTE: The `vslide1down` instruction can be used to load values into a
vector register without using memory and without disturbing other
vector registers.  This provides a path for debuggers to modify the
contents of a vector register, albeit slowly, with multiple repeated
`vslide1down` invocations.

[[sec-vfslide1down]]
===== Vector Floating-Point Slide1down Instruction

----
vfslide1down.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm      # vd[i] = vs2[i+1], vd[vl-1]=f[rs1]
----

The `vfslide1down` instruction is defined analogously to `vslide1down`,
but sources its scalar argument from an `f` register.

==== Vector Register Gather Instructions

The vector register gather instructions read elements from a first
source vector register group at locations given by a second source
vector register group.  The index values in the second vector are
treated as unsigned integers.  The source vector can be read at any
index < VLMAX regardless of `vl`.  The maximum number of elements to write to
the destination register is given by `vl`, and the remaining elements
past `vl` are handled according to the current tail policy
(Section <<sec-agnostic>>).  The operation can be masked, and the mask
undisturbed/agnostic policy is followed for inactive elements.

----
vrgather.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm     # vd[i] = (vs1[i] >= VLMAX) ? 0 : vs2[vs1[i]];
vrgatherei16.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vd[i] = (vs1[i] >= VLMAX) ? 0 : vs2[vs1[i]];
----

The `vrgather.vv` form uses SEW/LMUL for both the data and
indices. The `vrgatherei16.vv` form uses SEW/LMUL for the data in
`vs2` but EEW=16 and EMUL = (16/SEW)*LMUL for the indices in `vs1`.

NOTE: When SEW=8, `vrgather.vv` can only reference vector elements
0-255.  The `vrgatherei16` form can index 64K elements, and can also
be used to reduce the register capacity needed to hold indices when
SEW > 16.

If an element index is out of range ( `vs1[i]` {ge} VLMAX )
then zero is returned for the element value.

Vector-scalar and vector-immediate forms of the register gather are
also provided.  These read one element from the source vector at the
given index, and write this value to the active elements
of the destination vector register. The index value in the scalar
register and the immediate, zero-extended to XLEN bits, are treated as
unsigned integers.  If XLEN > SEW, the index value is _not_ truncated
to SEW bits.

NOTE: These forms allow any vector element to be "splatted" to an entire vector.

----
vrgather.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vd[i] = (x[rs1] >= VLMAX) ? 0 : vs2[x[rs1]]
vrgather.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm # vd[i] =  (uimm >= VLMAX)  ? 0 : vs2[uimm]
----

For any `vrgather` instruction, the destination vector register group
cannot overlap with the source vector register groups, otherwise the
instruction encoding is reserved.

==== Vector Compress Instruction

The vector compress instruction allows elements selected by a vector
mask register from a source vector register group to be packed into
contiguous elements at the start of the destination vector register
group.

----
vcompress.vm vd, vs2, vs1  # Compress into vd elements of vs2 where vs1 is enabled
----

The vector mask register specified by `vs1` indicates which of the
first `vl` elements of vector register group `vs2` should be extracted
and packed into contiguous elements at the beginning of vector
register `vd`. The remaining elements of `vd` are treated as tail
elements according to the current tail policy (Section
<<sec-agnostic>>).

----

1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1   v0

                        vcompress.vm v2, v1, v0
1 2 3 4 8 7 5 2 0   v2
----

`vcompress` is encoded as an unmasked instruction (`vm=1`). The equivalent
masked instruction (`vm=0`) is reserved.

The destination vector register group cannot overlap the source vector
register group or the source mask register, otherwise the instruction
encoding is reserved.

A trap on a `vcompress` instruction is always reported with a
`vstart` of 0.  Executing a `vcompress` instruction with a non-zero
`vstart` raises an illegal instruction exception.

NOTE: Although possible, `vcompress` is one of the more difficult
instructions to restart with a non-zero `vstart`, so assumption is
implementations will choose not do that but will instead restart from
element 0.  This does mean elements in destination register after
`vstart` will already have been updated.

===== Synthesizing `vdecompress`

There is no inverse `vdecompress` provided, as this operation can be
readily synthesized using iota and a masked vrgather:

----

==== Whole Vector Register Move

The `vmv<nr>r.v` instructions copy whole vector registers (i.e., all
VLEN bits) and can copy whole vector register groups.  The `nr` value
in the opcode is the number of individual vector registers, NREG, to
copy.  The instructions operate as if EEW=SEW, EMUL = NREG, effective
length `evl`= EMUL * VLEN/SEW.

NOTE: These instructions are intended to aid compilers to shuffle
vector registers without needing to know or change `vl`.

NOTE: The usual property that no elements are written if `vstart` {ge} `vl`
does not apply to these instructions.
Instead, no elements are written if `vstart` {ge} `evl`.

NOTE: If `vd` is equal to `vs2` the instruction is an architectural
NOP, but is treated as a hint to implementations that rearrange data
internally that the register group will next be accessed with an EEW
equal to SEW.

The instruction is encoded as an OPIVI instruction.  The number of
vector registers to copy is encoded in the low three bits of the
`simm` field (`simm[2:0]`) using the same encoding as the `nf[2:0]` field for memory
instructions (Figure <<fig-nf>>), i.e., `simm[2:0]` = NREG-1.

The value of NREG must be 1, 2, 4, or 8, and values of `simm[4:0]`
other than 0, 1, 3, and 7 are reserved.

NOTE: A future extension may support other numbers of registers to be moved.

NOTE: The instruction uses the same funct6 encoding as the `vsmul`
instruction but with an immediate operand, and only the unmasked
version (`vm=1`).  This encoding is chosen as it is close to the
related `vmerge` encoding, and it is unlikely the `vsmul` instruction
would benefit from an immediate form.

----
vmv<nr>r.v vd, vs2  # General form

vmv1r.v v1, v2   #  Copy v1=v2
vmv2r.v v10, v12 #  Copy v10=v12; v11=v13
vmv4r.v v4, v8   #  Copy v4=v8; v5=v9; v6=v10; v7=v11
vmv8r.v v0, v8   #  Copy v0=v8; v1=v9; ...;  v7=v15
----

The source and destination vector register numbers must be aligned
appropriately for the vector register group size, and encodings with
other vector register numbers are reserved.

NOTE: A future extension may relax the vector register alignment
restrictions.

=== Exception Handling

On a trap during a vector instruction (caused by either a synchronous
exception or an asynchronous interrupt), the existing `*epc` CSR is
written with a pointer to the trapping vector instruction, while the
`vstart` CSR contains the element index on which the trap was
taken.

NOTE: We chose to add a `vstart` CSR to allow resumption of a
partially executed vector instruction to reduce interrupt latencies
and to simplify forward-progress guarantees.  This is similar to the
scheme in the IBM 3090 vector facility.  To ensure forward progress
without the `vstart` CSR, implementations would have to guarantee an
entire vector instruction can always complete atomically without
generating a trap.  This is particularly difficult to ensure in the
presence of strided or scatter/gather operations and demand-paged
virtual memory.

==== Precise vector traps

NOTE: We assume most supervisor-mode environments with demand-paging
will require precise vector traps.

Precise vector traps require that:

. all instructions older than the trapping vector instruction have committed their results
. no instructions newer than the trapping vector instruction have altered architectural state
. any operations within the trapping vector instruction affecting result elements preceding the index in the `vstart` CSR have committed their results
. no operations within the trapping vector instruction affecting elements at or following the `vstart` CSR have altered architectural state except if restarting and completing the affected vector instruction will nevertheless produce the correct final state.

We relax the last requirement to allow elements following `vstart` to
have been updated at the time the trap is reported, provided that
re-executing the instruction from the given `vstart` will correctly
overwrite those elements.

In idempotent memory regions, vector store instructions may have
updated elements in memory past the element causing a synchronous
trap.  Non-idempotent memory regions must not have been updated for
indices equal to or greater than the element that caused a synchronous
trap during a vector store instruction.

Except where noted above, vector instructions are allowed to overwrite
their inputs, and so in most cases, the vector instruction restart
must be from the `vstart` element index. However, there are a number of
cases where this overwrite is prohibited to enable execution of the
vector instructions to be idempotent and hence restartable from an
earlier index location.

Implementations must ensure forward progress can be eventually
guaranteed for the element or segment reported by `vstart`.

==== Imprecise vector traps

Imprecise vector traps are traps that are not precise.  In particular,
instructions newer than `*epc` may have committed results, and
instructions older than `*epc` may have not completed execution.
Imprecise traps are primarily intended to be used in situations where
reporting an error and terminating execution is the appropriate
response.

NOTE: A profile might specify that interrupts are precise while other
traps are imprecise.  We assume many embedded implementations will
generate only imprecise traps for vector instructions on fatal errors,
as they will not require resumable traps.

Imprecise traps shall report the faulting element in `vstart` for
traps caused by synchronous vector exceptions.

There is no support for imprecise traps in the current standard extensions.

==== Selectable precise/imprecise traps

Some profiles may choose to provide a privileged mode bit to select
between precise and imprecise vector traps.  Imprecise mode would run
at high-performance but possibly make it difficult to discern error
causes, while precise mode would run more slowly, but support
debugging of errors albeit with a possibility of not experiencing the
same errors as in imprecise mode.

This mechanism is not defined in the current standard extensions.

==== Swappable traps

Another trap mode can support swappable state in the vector unit,
where on a trap, special instructions can save and restore the vector
unit microarchitectural state, to allow execution to continue
correctly around imprecise traps.

This mechanism is not defined in the current standard extensions.

NOTE: A future extension might define a standard way of saving and
restoring opaque microarchitectural state from a vector unit
implementation to support context switching with imprecise traps.

[[sec-vector-extensions]]
=== Standard Vector Extensions

This section describes the standard vector extensions.
A set of smaller extensions intended for embedded
use are named with a "Zve" prefix, while a larger vector extension
designed for application processors is named as a single-letter V
extension.  A set of vector length extension names with prefix "Zvl"
are also provided.

The initial vector extensions are designed to act as a base for
additional vector extensions in various domains, including
cryptography and machine learning.

==== Zvl*: Minimum Vector Length Standard Extensions

All standard vector extensions have a minimum required VLEN as
described below.  A set of vector length extensions are provided to
increase the minimum vector length of a vector extension.

NOTE: The vector length extensions can be used to either specify
additional software or architecture profile requirements, or to
advertise hardware capabilities.

.Vector length extensions
[cols="1,1"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",options="header"]
|===
| Extension  | Minimum VLEN

| Zvl32b     | 32
| Zvl64b     | 64
| Zvl128b    | 128
| Zvl256b    | 256
| Zvl512b    | 512
| Zvl1024b   | 1024
|===

NOTE: Longer vector length extensions should follow the same pattern.

NOTE: Every vector length extension effectively includes all shorter
vector length extensions.

NOTE: The syntax for extension names is being revised, and these names
are subject to change.  The trailing "b" will be required to
disambiguate numeric fields from version numbers.

NOTE: Explicit use of the Zvl32b extension string is not required for
any standard vector extension as they all effectively mandate at least
this minimum, but the string can be useful when stating hardware
capabilities.

==== Zve*: Vector Extensions for Embedded Processors

The following five standard extensions are defined to provide varying
degrees of vector support and are intended for use with embedded
processors.  Any of these extensions can be added to base ISAs with
XLEN=32 or XLEN=64.  The table lists the minimum VLEN and supported
EEWs for each extension as well as what floating-point types are
supported.

.Embedded vector extensions
[cols="1,1,2,1,1"]
[%autowidth,float="center",align="center",options="header"]
|===
| Extension | Minimum VLEN | Supported EEW |  FP32 | FP64

| Zve32x    | 32    | 8, 16, 32     |   N   |  N
| Zve32f    | 32    | 8, 16, 32     |   Y   |  N
| Zve64x    | 64    | 8, 16, 32, 64 |   N   |  N
| Zve64f    | 64    | 8, 16, 32, 64 |   Y   |  N
| Zve64d    | 64    | 8, 16, 32, 64 |   Y   |  Y
|===

The Zve32f and Zve64x extensions depend on the Zve32x extension.
The Zve64f extension depends on the Zve32f and Zve64x extensions.
The Zve64d extension depends on the Zve64f extension.

All Zve* extensions have precise traps.

NOTE: There is currently no standard support for handling imprecise
traps, so standard extensions have to provide precise traps.

All Zve* extensions provide support for EEW of 8, 16, and 32, and
Zve64* extensions also support EEW of 64.

All Zve* extensions support the vector configuration instructions
(Section <<sec-vector-config>>).

All Zve* extensions support all vector load and store instructions
(Section <<sec-vector-memory>>), except Zve64* extensions do not
support EEW=64 for index values when XLEN=32.

All Zve* extensions support all vector integer instructions (Section
<<sec-vector-integer>>), except that the `vmulh` integer multiply
variants that return the high word of the product (`vmulh.vv`,
`vmulh.vx`, `vmulhu.vv`, `vmulhu.vx`, `vmulhsu.vv`, `vmulhsu.vx`) are
not included for EEW=64 in Zve64*.

NOTE: Producing the high-word of a product can take substantial
additional gates for large EEW.

All Zve* extensions support all vector fixed-point arithmetic
instructions (<<sec-vector-fixed-point>>), except that `vsmul.vv` and
`vsmul.vx` are not included in EEW=64 in Zve64*.

NOTE: As with `vmulh`, `vsmul` requires a large amount of additional
logic, and 64-bit fixed-point multiplies are relatively rare.

All Zve* extensions support all vector integer single-width and
widening reduction operations (Sections <<sec-vector-integer-reduce>>,
<<sec-vector-integer-reduce-widen>>).

All Zve* extensions support all vector mask instructions (Section
<<sec-vector-mask>>).

All Zve* extensions support all vector permutation instructions
(Section <<sec-vector-permute>>), except that Zve32x and Zve64x
do not include those with floating-point operands, and Zve64f does not include those
with EEW=64 floating-point operands.

The Zve32x extension depends on the Zicsr extension.
The Zve32f and Zve64f extensions depend upon the F extension,
and implement all
vector floating-point instructions (Section <<sec-vector-float>>) for
floating-point operands with EEW=32. Vector single-width floating-point reduction
operations (<<sec-vector-float-reduce>>) for EEW=32 are supported.

The Zve64d extension depends upon the D extension,
and implements all vector
floating-point instructions (Section <<sec-vector-float>>) for
floating-point operands with EEW=32 or EEW=64 (including widening
instructions and conversions between FP32 and FP64). Vector
single-width floating-point reductions (<<sec-vector-float-reduce>>)
for EEW=32 and EEW=64 are supported as well as widening reductions
from FP32 to FP64.

==== V: Vector Extension for Application Processors

The single-letter V extension is intended for use in application
processor profiles.

The `misa.v` bit is set for implementations providing `misa` and
supporting V.

The V vector extension has precise traps.

The V vector extension depends upon the Zvl128b and Zve64d extensions.

NOTE: The value of 128 was chosen as a compromise for application
processors. Providing a larger VLEN allows stripmining code to be
elided in some cases for short vectors, but also increases the size of
the minimum implementation.  Note that larger LMUL can be used to
avoid stripmining for longer known-size application vectors at the
cost of having fewer available vector register groups. For example, an
LMUL of 8 allows vectors of up to sixteen 64-bit elements to be
processed without stripmining using four vector register groups.

The V extension supports EEW of 8, 16, and 32, and 64.

The V extension supports the vector configuration instructions
(Section <<sec-vector-config>>).

The V extension supports all vector load and store instructions
(Section <<sec-vector-memory>>), except the V extension does not
support EEW=64 for index values when XLEN=32.

The V extension supports all vector integer instructions (Section
<<sec-vector-integer>>).

The V extension supports all vector fixed-point arithmetic
instructions (<<sec-vector-fixed-point>>).

The V extension supports all vector integer single-width and
widening reduction operations (Sections <<sec-vector-integer-reduce>>,
<<sec-vector-integer-reduce-widen>>).

The V extension supports all vector mask instructions (Section
<<sec-vector-mask>>).

The V extension supports all vector permutation instructions (Section
<<sec-vector-permute>>).

The V extension depends upon the F and D
extensions, and implements all vector floating-point instructions
(Section <<sec-vector-float>>) for floating-point operands with EEW=32
or EEW=64 (including widening instructions and conversions between
FP32 and FP64). Vector single-width floating-point reductions
(<<sec-vector-float-reduce>>) for EEW=32 and EEW=64 are supported as
well as widening reductions from FP32 to FP64.

[NOTE]
====
As is the case with other RISC-V extensions, it is valid to
include overlapping extensions in the same ISA string.  For example,
RV64GCV and RV64GCV_Zve64f are both valid and equivalent ISA strings,
as is RV64GCV_Zve64f_Zve32x_Zvl128b.

==== Zvfhmin: Vector Extension for Minimal Half-Precision Floating-Point

The Zvfhmin extension provides minimal support for vectors of IEEE 754-2008
binary16 values, adding conversions to and from binary32.
When the Zvfhmin extension is implemented, the `vfwcvt.f.f.v` and
`vfncvt.f.f.w` instructions become defined when SEW=16.
The EEW=16 floating-point operands of these instructions use the binary16
format.

The Zvfhmin extension depends on the Zve32f extension.

==== Zvfh: Vector Extension for Half-Precision Floating-Point

The Zvfh extension provides support for vectors of IEEE 754-2008
binary16 values.
When the Zvfh extension is implemented, all instructions in Sections
<<sec-vector-float>>, <<sec-vector-float-reduce>>,
<<sec-vector-float-reduce-widen>>, <<sec-vector-float-move>>,
<<sec-vfslide1up>>, and <<sec-vfslide1down>>
become defined when SEW=16.
The EEW=16 floating-point operands of these instructions use the binary16
format.

Additionally, conversions between 8-bit integers and binary16 values are
provided.  The floating-point-to-integer narrowing conversions
(`vfncvt[.rtz].x[u].f.w`) and integer-to-floating-point
widening conversions (`vfwcvt.f.x[u].v`) become defined when SEW=8.

The Zvfh extension depends on the Zve32f and Zfhmin extensions.

NOTE: Requiring basic scalar half-precision support makes Zvfh's
vector-scalar instructions substantially more useful.
We considered requiring more complete scalar half-precision support, but we
reasoned that, for many half-precision vector workloads, performing the scalar
computation in single-precision will suffice.

[[vector-element-groups]]
=== Vector Element Groups

Some vector instructions treat operands as a vector of one or more
_element_ _groups_, where each element group is a fixed number of
elements.  For example, complex numbers can be viewed as a two-element
group (one real element and one imaginary element).
As another example, the SHA-256 cryptographic instructions in the Zvknha
extension operate on 128-bit values represented as a 4-element group of 32-bit
elements.

This section describes recommendations and terminology for generic
instruction set design for vector instructions that operate on element
groups.

==== Element Group Size

The _element_ _group_ _size_ (EGS) is the number of elements in one
group, and must be a power-of-two (POT).

NOTE: Support for non-POT EGS was considered but causes many practical
complications and so has been dropped.  Error checking for `vl` is a
little more difficult.  For LMUL>1, non-POT EGSs will result in groups
straddling the individual vector registers in a vector register
group. Non-POT EGS can also cause large increases in the
lowest-common-multiple of element group sizes, which adds constraints
to `vl` setting in order to avoid splitting an element group across
stripmine iterations in vector-length-agnostic code.

The element group size is statically encoded in the instruction, often
implicitly as part of the opcode.

Executing a vector instruction with EGS > VLMAX causes an illegal
instruction exception to be raised.

NOTE: The vector instructions in the base V vector ISA can be viewed
as all having an element group size of 1 for all operands statically
encoded in the instruction.

NOTE: Many operations only make sense with a certain number of
elements per group (e.g., complex operations require a element group
size of 2 and SHA-256 requires an element group size of 4).

==== Setting `vl`

Each source and destination operand to a vector instruction might be
defined as either a single element group or a vector of element
groups.  When an operand is a vector of element groups, the `vl`
setting must correspond to an integer multiple of the element group
size, with other values of `vl` reserved.

NOTE: For example, a SHA-256 instruction would require that `vl` is a
multiple of 4.

When element group instructions are present, an additional constraint
is placed on the setting of `vl` based on an AVL value
(augmenting <<constraints-on-setting-vl>>).
EGSMAX is the largest EGS supported by the
implementation.  When AVL > VLMAX, the value of `vl` must be set to
either VLMAX or a positive integer multiple of EGSMAX.

NOTE: As the base vector extension only has element group size of 1,
this constraint is backwards-compatible.

NOTE: This constraint prevents element groups being broken across
stripmining iterations in vector-length-agnostic code when a
VLMAX-size vector would otherwise be able to accommodate a whole number
of element groups.

NOTE: If EEW is encoded statically in the instruction, or if an
instruction has multiple operands containing vectors of element groups
with different EEW, an appropriate SEW must be chosen for `vsetvl`
instructions.

NOTE: Additional constraints may be required for some element group
instructions to ensure legal length values for all operands.

==== Determining EEW 

The `vtype` SEW can be used to indicate or calculate the effective
element size (EEW) of one or more operands of an element group
instruction.  Where the operand is an element group, SEW and EEW refer
to the number of bits in each individual element within a group not
the number of bits in the group as a whole.

Alternatively, the opcode might encode EEW of all operands statically
and ignore the value of SEW when the operation only makes sense for a
single size on each operand.

NOTE: Many operations are only defined for one EEW, e.g., SHA-256
requires EEW=32.  Encoding EEWs statically in the instruction removes
a dynamic dependency on the SEW value and the need to check for errors
in SEW values.  However, ignoring SEW also prevents reuse of the
static opcode with a different dynamic SEW, and in many cases, the SEW
setting will be needed for regular vector instructions used to process
the individual elements in the vector.

==== Determining EMUL

The `vtype` LMUL setting can be used to indicate or calculate the
effective length multiplier (EMUL) for one or more operands.  Element
group instructions tend to exhibit a much wider range of relationships
between various operand EEW/EMUL values.  For example, an instruction
might take a vector of length N of 4-element groups with EEW=8b and
reduce each group to produce a vector length N of 1-element groups
with EEW=32b. In this case, the input and output EMUL values are equal
even though the EEW settings differ by a factor of 4.

Each source and destination operand to a vector instruction may have a
different element group size, different EMUL, and/or different EEW.

==== Element Group Width

The _element_ _group_ _width_ (EGW) is the number of bits in the
element group as a whole.
For example, the SHA-256 instructions in the Zvknha extension operate on an
EGW of 128, with EGS=4 and EEW=32.
It is possible to use LMUL to concatenate multiple vector registers together
to support larger EGW>VLEN.

NOTE: If software using large-EGW instructions need be portable
across a range of implementations, some of which may have VLEN<EGW and
hence require LMUL>1, then software can only use a subset of the
architectural registers.  Profiles can set minimum VLEN requirements
to inform authors of such software.

NOTE: Element group operations by their nature will gather data from
across a wider portion of a vector datapath than regular vector
instructions.  Some element group instructions might allow temporal
execution of individual element operations in a larger group, while
others will require all EGW bits of a group to be presented to a
functional unit at the same time.

==== Masking

No ratified extensions include masked element-group instructions.
Future extensions might extend the element-group scheme to support
element-level masking, or might define the concept of a _mask element group_
(which might, e.g., update the destination element group if any mask bit in
the mask element group is set).
