== "P" Extension for Packed-SIMD Instructions, Version 0.2
[NOTE]
====
Discussions at the 5th RISC-V workshop indicated a desire to drop this
packed-SIMD proposal for floating-point registers in favor of
standardizing on the V extension for large floating-point SIMD
operations. However, there was interest in packed-SIMD fixed-point
operations for use in the integer registers of small RISC-V
implementations. A task group is working to define the new P extension.
