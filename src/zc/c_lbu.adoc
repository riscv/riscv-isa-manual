Description::
This instruction loads a byte from the memory address formed by adding _rs1'_ to the zero extended immediate _uimm_. The resulting byte is zero extended to XLEN bits and is written to _rd'_. 

[NOTE]
====
  _rd'_ and _rs1'_ are from the standard 8-register set x8-x15.

Prerequisites::
None

32-bit equivalent::

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.

X(rdc) = EXTZ(mem[X(rs1c)+EXTZ(uimm)][7..0]);
