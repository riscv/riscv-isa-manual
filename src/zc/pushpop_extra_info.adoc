[NOTE]

  All ABI register mappings are for the UABI. An EABI version is planned once the EABI is frozen.

For further information see <<insns-pushpop>>.

Stack Adjustment Calculation::

_stack_adj_base_ is the minimum number of bytes, in multiples of 16-byte address increments, required to cover the registers in the list. 

_spimm_ is the number of additional 16-byte address increments allocated for the stack frame.

The total stack adjustment represents the total size of the stack frame, which is _stack_adj_base_ added to _spimm_ scaled by 16, 
as defined above.
