== Formal Axiomatic Specification in Herd

The tool [.sans-serif]#herd# takes a memory model and a litmus test as
input and simulates the execution of the test on top of the memory
model. Memory models are written in the domain specific language Cat.
This section provides two Cat memory model of RVWMO. The first model,
Figure #fig:herd2[[fig:herd2]], follows the _global memory order_,
Chapter #ch:memorymodel[[ch:memorymodel]], definition of RVWMO, as much
as is possible for a Cat model. The second model,
Figure #fig:herd3[[fig:herd3]], is an equivalent, more efficient,
partial order based RVWMO model.

The simulator [.sans-serif]#herd# is part of the [.sans-serif]#diy# tool
suite — see http://diy.inria.fr for software and documentation. The
models and more are available online
at http://diy.inria.fr/cats7/riscv/.
