== Introduction


RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is a new instruction-set architecture
(ISA) that was originally designed to support computer architecture
research and education, but which we now hope will also become a
standard free and open architecture for industry implementations. Our
goals in defining RISC-V include:

* A completely _open_ ISA that is freely available to academia and
industry.
* A _real_ ISA suitable for direct native hardware implementation, not
just simulation or binary translation.
* An ISA that avoids "over-architecting" for a particular
microarchitecture style (e.g., microcoded, in-order, decoupled,
out-of-order) or implementation technology (e.g., full-custom, ASIC,
FPGA), but which allows efficient implementation in any of these.
* An ISA separated into a _small_ base integer ISA, usable by itself as
a base for customized accelerators or for educational purposes, and
optional standard extensions, to support general-purpose software
development.
* Support for the revised 2008 IEEE-754 floating-point standard. cite:[ieee754-2008]
* An ISA supporting extensive ISA extensions and specialized variants.
* Both 32-bit and 64-bit address space variants for applications,
operating system kernels, and hardware implementations.
* An ISA with support for highly parallel multicore or manycore
implementations, including heterogeneous multiprocessors.
* Optional _variable-length instructions_ to both expand available
instruction encoding space and to support an optional _dense instruction
encoding_ for improved performance, static code size, and energy
efficiency.
* A fully virtualizable ISA to ease hypervisor development.
* An ISA that simplifies experiments with new privileged architecture
designs.

[NOTE]
====
The name RISC-V was chosen to represent the fifth major RISC ISA design
from UC Berkeley (RISC-I cite:[riscI-isca1981], RISC-II cite:[Katevenis:1983], SOAR cite:[Ungar:1984], and SPUR cite:[spur-jsscc1989] were the first
four). We also pun on the use of the Roman numeral "V" to signify
"variations" and "vectors", as support for a range of architecture
research, including various data-parallel accelerators, is an explicit
goal of the ISA design.
====
(((ISA, definition)))
The RISC-V ISA is defined avoiding implementation details as much as
possible (although commentary is included on implementation-driven
decisions) and should be read as the software-visible interface to a
wide variety of implementations rather than as the design of a
particular hardware artifact. The RISC-V manual is structured in two
volumes. This volume covers the design of the base _unprivileged_
instructions, including optional unprivileged ISA extensions.
Unprivileged instructions are those that are generally usable in all
privilege modes in all privileged architectures, though behavior might
vary depending on privilege mode and privilege architecture. The second
volume provides the design of the first ("classic") privileged
architecture. The manuals use IEC 80000-13:2008 conventions, with a byte
of 8 bits.

[NOTE]
====
In the unprivileged ISA design, we tried to remove any dependence on
particular microarchitectural features, such as cache line size, or on
privileged architecture details, such as page translation. This is both
for simplicity and to allow maximum flexibility for alternative
microarchitectures or alternative privileged architectures.

=== RISC-V Hardware Platform Terminology


A RISC-V hardware platform can contain one or more RISC-V-compatible
processing cores together with other non-RISC-V-compatible cores,
fixed-function accelerators, various physical memory structures, I/O
devices, and an interconnect structure to allow the components to
communicate.
(((core, component)))

A component is termed a _core_ if it contains an independent instruction
fetch unit. A RISC-V-compatible core might support multiple
RISC-V-compatible hardware threads, or _harts_, through multithreading.
(((core, extensions, coprocessor)))

A RISC-V core might have additional specialized instruction-set
extensions or an added _coprocessor_. We use the term _coprocessor_ to
refer to a unit that is attached to a RISC-V core and is mostly
sequenced by a RISC-V instruction stream, but which contains additional
architectural state and instruction-set extensions, and possibly some
limited autonomy relative to the primary RISC-V instruction stream.

We use the term _accelerator_ to refer to either a non-programmable
fixed-function unit or a core that can operate autonomously but is
specialized for certain tasks. In RISC-V systems, we expect many
programmable accelerators will be RISC-V-based cores with specialized
instruction-set extensions and/or customized coprocessors. An important
class of RISC-V accelerators are I/O accelerators, which offload I/O
processing tasks from the main application cores.
(((core, accelerator)))

The system-level organization of a RISC-V hardware platform can range
from a single-core microcontroller to a many-thousand-node cluster of
shared-memory manycore server nodes. Even small systems-on-a-chip might
be structured as a hierarchy of multicomputers and/or multiprocessors to
modularize development effort or to provide secure isolation between
subsystems.
(((core, cluster, multiprocessors)))

=== RISC-V Software Execution Environments and Harts


The behavior of a RISC-V program depends on the execution environment in
which it runs. A RISC-V execution environment interface (EEI) defines
the initial state of the program, the number and type of harts in the
environment including the privilege modes supported by the harts, the
accessibility and attributes of memory and I/O regions, the behavior of
all legal instructions executed on each hart (i.e., the ISA is one
component of the EEI), and the handling of any interrupts or exceptions
raised during execution including environment calls. Examples of EEIs
include the Linux application binary interface (ABI), or the RISC-V
supervisor binary interface (SBI). The implementation of a RISC-V
execution environment can be pure hardware, pure software, or a
combination of hardware and software. For example, opcode traps and
software emulation can be used to implement functionality not provided
in hardware. Examples of execution environment implementations include:

* "Bare metal" hardware platforms where harts are directly implemented
by physical processor threads and instructions have full access to the
physical address space. The hardware platform defines an execution
environment that begins at power-on reset.
* RISC-V operating systems that provide multiple user-level execution
environments by multiplexing user-level harts onto available physical
processor threads and by controlling access to memory via virtual
memory.
* RISC-V hypervisors that provide multiple supervisor-level execution
environments for guest operating systems.
* RISC-V emulators, such as Spike, QEMU or rv8, which emulate RISC-V
harts on an underlying x86 system, and which can provide either a
user-level or a supervisor-level execution environment.

[NOTE]
====
A bare hardware platform can be considered to define an EEI, where the
accessible harts, memory, and other devices populate the environment,
and the initial state is that at power-on reset. Generally, most
software is designed to use a more abstract interface to the hardware,
as more abstract EEIs provide greater portability across different
hardware platforms. Often EEIs are layered on top of one another, where
one higher-level EEI uses another lower-level EEI.
====
(((hart, execution environment)))
From the perspective of software running in a given execution
environment, a hart is a resource that autonomously fetches and executes
RISC-V instructions within that execution environment. In this respect,
a hart behaves like a hardware thread resource even if time-multiplexed
onto real hardware by the execution environment. Some EEIs support the
creation and destruction of additional harts, for example, via
environment calls to fork new harts.

The execution environment is responsible for ensuring the eventual
forward progress of each of its harts. For a given hart, that
responsibility is suspended while the hart is exercising a mechanism
that explicitly waits for an event, such as the wait-for-interrupt
instruction defined in Volume II of this specification; and that
responsibility ends if the hart is terminated. The following events
constitute forward progress:

* The retirement of an instruction.
* A trap, as defined in <<trap-defn, Section 1.6>>.
* Any other event defined by an extension to constitute forward
progress.

[NOTE]
====
The term hart was introduced in the work on Lithe cite:[lithe-pan-hotpar09] and cite:[lithe-pan-pldi10] to provide a term to
represent an abstract execution resource as opposed to a software thread
programming abstraction.

The important distinction between a hardware thread (hart) and a
software thread context is that the software running inside an execution
environment is not responsible for causing progress of each of its
harts; that is the responsibility of the outer execution environment. So
the environment's harts operate like hardware threads from the
perspective of the software inside the execution environment.

An execution environment implementation might time-multiplex a set of
guest harts onto fewer host harts provided by its own execution
environment but must do so in a way that guest harts operate like
independent hardware threads. In particular, if there are more guest
harts than host harts then the execution environment must be able to
preempt the guest harts and must not wait indefinitely for guest
software on a guest hart to "yield" control of the guest hart.
====

=== RISC-V ISA Overview


A RISC-V ISA is defined as a base integer ISA, which must be present in
any implementation, plus optional extensions to the base ISA. The base
integer ISAs are very similar to that of the early RISC processors
except with no branch delay slots and with support for optional
variable-length instruction encodings. A base is carefully restricted to
a minimal set of instructions sufficient to provide a reasonable target
for compilers, assemblers, linkers, and operating systems (with
additional privileged operations), and so provides a convenient ISA and
software toolchain "skeleton" around which more customized processor
ISAs can be built.

Although it is convenient to speak of _the_ RISC-V ISA, RISC-V is
actually a family of related ISAs, of which there are currently four
base ISAs. Each base integer instruction set is characterized by the
width of the integer registers and the corresponding size of the address
space and by the number of integer registers. There are two primary base
integer variants, RV32I and RV64I, described in
<<rv32>> and <<rv64>>, which provide 32-bit
or 64-bit address spaces respectively. We use the term XLEN to refer to
the width of an integer register in bits (either 32 or 64).
<<rv32e, Chapter 6>> describes the RV32E and RV64E subset variants of the
RV32I or RV64I base instruction sets respectively, which have been added to support small
microcontrollers, and which have half the number of integer registers.
<<rv128, Chapter 8>> sketches a future RV128I variant of the
base integer instruction set supporting a flat 128-bit address space
(XLEN=128). The base integer instruction sets use a two's-complement
representation for signed integer values.


[NOTE]
====
Although 64-bit address spaces are a requirement for larger systems, we
believe 32-bit address spaces will remain adequate for many embedded and
client devices for decades to come and will be desirable to lower memory
traffic and energy consumption. In addition, 32-bit address spaces are
sufficient for educational purposes. A larger flat 128-bit address space
might eventually be required, so we ensured this could be accommodated
within the RISC-V ISA framework.
====

[NOTE]
====
The four base ISAs in RISC-V are treated as distinct base ISAs. A common
question is why is there not a single ISA, and in particular, why is
RV32I not a strict subset of RV64I? Some earlier ISA designs (SPARC,
MIPS) adopted a strict superset policy when increasing address space
size to support running existing 32-bit binaries on new 64-bit hardware.

The main advantage of explicitly separating base ISAs is that each base
ISA can be optimized for its needs without requiring to support all the
operations needed for other base ISAs. For example, RV64I can omit
instructions and CSRs that are only needed to cope with the narrower
registers in RV32I. The RV32I variants can use encoding space otherwise
reserved for instructions only required by wider address-space variants.

The main disadvantage of not treating the design as a single ISA is that
it complicates the hardware needed to emulate one base ISA on another
(e.g., RV32I on RV64I). However, differences in addressing and
illegal-instruction traps generally mean some mode switch would be required in
hardware in any case even with full superset instruction encodings, and
the different RISC-V base ISAs are similar enough that supporting
multiple versions is relatively low cost. Although some have proposed
that the strict superset design would allow legacy 32-bit libraries to
be linked with 64-bit code, this is impractical in practice, even with
compatible encodings, due to the differences in software calling
conventions and system-call interfaces.

The RISC-V privileged architecture provides fields in `misa` to control
the unprivileged ISA at each level to support emulating different base
ISAs on the same hardware. We note that newer SPARC and MIPS ISA
revisions have deprecated support for running 32-bit code unchanged on
64-bit systems.

A related question is why there is a different encoding for 32-bit adds
in RV32I (ADD) and RV64I (ADDW)? The ADDW opcode could be used for
32-bit adds in RV32I and ADDD for 64-bit adds in RV64I, instead of the
existing design which uses the same opcode ADD for 32-bit adds in RV32I
and 64-bit adds in RV64I with a different opcode ADDW for 32-bit adds in
RV64I. This would also be more consistent with the use of the same LW
opcode for 32-bit load in both RV32I and RV64I. The very first versions
of RISC-V ISA did have a variant of this alternate design, but the
RISC-V design was changed to the current choice in January 2011. Our
focus was on supporting 32-bit integers in the 64-bit ISA not on
providing compatibility with the 32-bit ISA, and the motivation was to
remove the asymmetry that arose from having not all opcodes in RV32I
have a *W suffix (e.g., ADDW, but AND not ANDW). In hindsight, this was
perhaps not well-justified and a consequence of designing both ISAs at
the same time as opposed to adding one later to sit on top of another,
and also from a belief we had to fold platform requirements into the ISA
spec which would imply that all the RV32I instructions would have been
required in RV64I. It is too late to change the encoding now, but this
is also of little practical consequence for the reasons stated above.

It has been noted we could enable the *W variants as an extension to
RV32I systems to provide a common encoding across RV64I and a future
RV32 variant.
====

RISC-V has been designed to support extensive customization and
specialization. Each base integer ISA can be extended with one or more
optional instruction-set extensions. An extension may be categorized as
either standard, custom, or non-conforming. For this purpose, we divide
each RISC-V instruction-set encoding space (and related encoding spaces
such as the CSRs) into three disjoint categories: _standard_,
_reserved_, and _custom_. Standard extensions and encodings are defined
by RISC-V International; any extensions not defined by RISC-V International are
_non-standard_. Each base ISA and its standard extensions use only
standard encodings, and shall not conflict with each other in their uses
of these encodings. Reserved encodings are currently not defined but are
saved for future standard extensions; once thus used, they become
standard encodings. Custom encodings shall never be used for standard
extensions and are made available for vendor-specific non-standard
extensions. Non-standard extensions are either custom extensions, that
use only custom encodings, or _non-conforming_ extensions, that use any
standard or reserved encoding. Instruction-set extensions are generally
shared but may provide slightly different functionality depending on the
base ISA. <<extending>> describes various ways
of extending the RISC-V ISA. We have also developed a naming convention
for RISC-V base instructions and instruction-set extensions, described
in detail in <<naming>>.

To support more general software development, a set of standard
extensions are defined to provide integer multiply/divide, atomic
operations, and single and double-precision floating-point arithmetic.
The base integer ISA is named "I" (prefixed by RV32 or RV64 depending
on integer register width), and contains integer computational
instructions, integer loads, integer stores, and control-flow
instructions. The standard integer multiplication and division extension
is named "M", and adds instructions to multiply and divide values held
in the integer registers. The standard atomic instruction extension,
denoted by "A", adds instructions that atomically read, modify, and
write memory for inter-processor synchronization. The standard
single-precision floating-point extension, denoted by "F", adds
floating-point registers, single-precision computational instructions,
and single-precision loads and stores. The standard double-precision
floating-point extension, denoted by "D", expands the floating-point
registers, and adds double-precision computational instructions, loads,
and stores. The standard "C" compressed instruction extension provides
narrower 16-bit forms of common instructions.

Beyond the base integer ISA and these standard extensions, we believe
it is rare that a new instruction will provide a significant benefit for
all applications, although it may be very beneficial for a certain
domain. As energy efficiency concerns are forcing greater
specialization, we believe it is important to simplify the required
portion of an ISA specification. Whereas other architectures usually
treat their ISA as a single entity, which changes to a new version as
instructions are added over time, RISC-V will endeavor to keep the base
and each standard extension constant over time, and instead layer new
instructions as further optional extensions. For example, the base
integer ISAs will continue as fully supported standalone ISAs,
regardless of any subsequent extensions.

=== Memory


A RISC-V hart has a single byte-addressable address space of
latexmath:[$2^{\text{XLEN}}$] bytes for all memory accesses. A _word_ of
memory is defined as 32{nbsp}bits (4{nbsp}bytes). Correspondingly, a _halfword_ is 16{nbsp}bits (2{nbsp}bytes), a
_doubleword_ is 64{nbsp}bits (8{nbsp}bytes), and a _quadword_ is 128{nbsp}bits (16{nbsp}bytes). The memory address space is
circular, so that the byte at address latexmath:[$2^{\text{XLEN}}-1$] is
adjacent to the byte at address zero. Accordingly, memory address
computations done by the hardware ignore overflow and instead wrap
around modulo latexmath:[$2^{\text{XLEN}}$].

The execution environment determines the mapping of hardware resources
into a hart's address space. Different address ranges of a hart's
address space may (1) contain _main memory_, or
(2) contain one or more _I/O devices_. Reads and writes of I/O devices
may have visible side effects, but accesses to main memory cannot.
Vacant address ranges are not a separate category but can be represented as
either main memory or I/O regions that are not accessible.
Although it is possible for the execution environment to call everything
in a hart's address space an I/O device, it is usually expected that
some portion will be specified as main memory.

When a RISC-V platform has multiple harts, the address spaces of any two
harts may be entirely the same, or entirely different, or may be partly
different but sharing some subset of resources, mapped into the same or
different address ranges.

[NOTE]
====
For a purely "bare metal" environment, all harts may see an identical
address space, accessed entirely by physical addresses. However, when
the execution environment includes an operating system employing address
translation, it is common for each hart to be given a virtual address
space that is largely or entirely its own.
====
(((memory access, implicit and explicit)))

Executing each RISC-V machine instruction entails one or more memory
accesses, subdivided into _implicit_ and _explicit_ accesses. For each
instruction executed, an _implicit_ memory read (instruction fetch) is
done to obtain the encoded instruction to execute. Many RISC-V
instructions perform no further memory accesses beyond instruction
fetch. Specific load and store instructions perform an _explicit_ read
or write of memory at an address determined by the instruction. The
execution environment may dictate that instruction execution performs
other _implicit_ memory accesses (such as to implement address
translation) beyond those documented for the unprivileged ISA.

The execution environment determines what portions of the
address space are accessible for each kind of memory access. For
example, the set of locations that can be implicitly read for
instruction fetch may or may not have any overlap with the set of
locations that can be explicitly read by a load instruction; and the set
of locations that can be explicitly written by a store instruction may
be only a subset of locations that can be read. Ordinarily, if an
instruction attempts to access memory at an inaccessible address, an
exception is raised for the instruction.

Except when specified otherwise, implicit reads that do not raise an
exception and that have no side effects may occur arbitrarily early and
speculatively, even before the machine could possibly prove that the
read will be needed. For instance, a valid implementation could attempt
to read all of main memory at the earliest opportunity, cache as many
fetchable (executable) bytes as possible for later instruction fetches,
and avoid reading main memory for instruction fetches ever again. To
ensure that certain implicit reads are ordered only after writes to the
same memory locations, software must execute specific fence or
cache-control instructions defined for this purpose (such as the FENCE.I
instruction defined in <<zifencei>>).
(((memory access, implicit and explicit)))

The memory accesses (implicit or explicit) made by a hart may appear to
occur in a different order as perceived by another hart or by any other
agent that can access the same memory. This perceived reordering of
memory accesses is always constrained, however, by the applicable memory
consistency model. The default memory consistency model for RISC-V is
the RISC-V Weak Memory Ordering (RVWMO), defined in
<<memorymodel>> and in appendices. Optionally,
an implementation may adopt the stronger model of Total Store Ordering,
as defined in <<ztso>>. The execution environment
may also add constraints that further limit the perceived reordering of
memory accesses. Since the RVWMO model is the weakest model allowed for
any RISC-V implementation, software written for this model is compatible
with the actual memory consistency rules of all RISC-V implementations.
As with implicit reads, software must execute fence or cache-control
instructions to ensure specific ordering of memory accesses beyond the
requirements of the assumed memory consistency model and execution
environment.

=== Base Instruction-Length Encoding

The base RISC-V ISA has fixed-length 32-bit instructions that must be
naturally aligned on 32-bit boundaries. However, the standard RISC-V
encoding scheme is designed to support ISA extensions with
variable-length instructions, where each instruction can be any number
of 16-bit instruction _parcels_ in length and parcels are naturally
aligned on 16-bit boundaries. The standard compressed ISA extension
described in <<compressed>> reduces code size by
providing compressed 16-bit instructions and relaxes the alignment
constraints to allow all instructions (16 bit and 32 bit) to be aligned
on any 16-bit boundary to improve code density.

We use the term IALIGN (measured in bits) to refer to the
instruction-address alignment constraint the implementation enforces.
IALIGN is 32 bits in the base ISA, but some ISA extensions, including
the compressed ISA extension, relax IALIGN to 16 bits. IALIGN may not
take on any value other than 16 or 32.
(((ILEN)))

We use the term ILEN (measured in bits) to refer to the maximum
instruction length supported by an implementation, and which is always a
multiple of IALIGN. For implementations supporting only a base
instruction set, ILEN is 32 bits. Implementations supporting longer
instructions have larger values of ILEN.

<<instlengthcode>> illustrates the standard
RISC-V instruction-length encoding convention. All the 32-bit
instructions in the base ISA have their lowest two bits set to `11`. The
optional compressed 16-bit instruction-set extensions have their lowest
two bits equal to `00`, `01`, or `10`.

==== Expanded Instruction-Length Encoding
A portion of the 32-bit instruction-encoding space has been tentatively
allocated for instructions longer than 32 bits. The entirety of this
space is reserved at this time, and the following proposal for encoding
instructions longer than 32 bits is not considered frozen.
(((instruction length encoding)))

Standard instruction-set extensions encoded with more than 32 bits have
additional low-order bits set to `1`, with the conventions for 48-bit
and 64-bit lengths shown in
<<instlengthcode>>. Instruction lengths
between 80 bits and 176 bits are encoded using a 3-bit field in bits
[14:12] giving the number of 16-bit words in addition to the first
5latexmath:[$\times$]16-bit words. The encoding with bits [14:12] set to
"111" is reserved for future longer instruction encodings.

|===

[NOTE]
====
Given the code size and energy savings of a compressed format, we wanted
to build in support for a compressed format to the ISA encoding scheme
rather than adding this as an afterthought, but to allow simpler
implementations we didn't want to make the compressed format mandatory.
We also wanted to optionally allow longer instructions to support
experimentation and larger instruction-set extensions. Although our
encoding convention required a tighter encoding of the core RISC-V ISA,
this has several beneficial effects.
(((IMAFD)))

An implementation of the standard IMAFD ISA need only hold the
most-significant 30 bits in instruction caches (a 6.25% saving). On
instruction cache refills, any instructions encountered with either low
bit clear should be recoded into illegal 30-bit instructions before
storing in the cache to preserve illegal-instruction exception behavior.

Perhaps more importantly, by condensing our base ISA into a subset of
the 32-bit instruction word, we leave more space available for
non-standard and custom extensions. In particular, the base RV32I ISA
uses less than 1/8 of the encoding space in the 32-bit instruction word.
As described in <<extending>>, an implementation that does not require support
for the standard compressed instruction extension can map 3 additional non-conforming
30-bit instruction spaces into the 32-bit fixed-width format, while preserving
support for standard &#8805;32-bit instruction-set
extensions. Further, if the implementation also does not need
instructions >32-bits in length, it can recover a further
four major opcodes for non-conforming extensions.
====

Encodings with bits [15:0] all zeros are defined as illegal
instructions. These instructions are considered to be of minimal length:
16 bits if any 16-bit instruction-set extension is present, otherwise 32
bits. The encoding with bits [ILEN-1:0] all ones is also illegal; this
instruction is considered to be ILEN bits long.

[NOTE]
====
We consider it a feature that any length of instruction containing all
zero bits is not legal, as this quickly traps erroneous jumps into
zeroed memory regions. Similarly, we also reserve the instruction
encoding containing all ones to be an illegal instruction, to catch the
other common pattern observed with unprogrammed non-volatile memory
devices, disconnected memory buses, or broken memory devices.

Software can rely on a naturally aligned 32-bit word containing zero to
act as an illegal instruction on all RISC-V implementations, to be used
by software where an illegal instruction is explicitly desired. Defining
a corresponding known illegal value for all ones is more difficult due
to the variable-length encoding. Software cannot generally use the
illegal value of ILEN bits of all 1s, as software might not know ILEN
for the eventual target machine (e.g., if software is compiled into a
standard binary library used by many different machines). Defining a
32-bit word of all ones as illegal was also considered, as all machines
must support a 32-bit instruction size, but this requires the
instruction-fetch unit on machines with ILEN >32 report an
illegal-instruction exception rather than an access-fault exception when
such an instruction borders a protection boundary, complicating
variable-instruction-length fetch and decode.
====
(((endian, little and big)))
RISC-V base ISAs have either little-endian or big-endian memory systems,
with the privileged architecture further defining bi-endian operation.
Instructions are stored in memory as a sequence of 16-bit little-endian
parcels, regardless of memory system endianness. Parcels forming one
instruction are stored at increasing halfword addresses, with the
lowest-addressed parcel holding the lowest-numbered bits in the
instruction specification.
(((bi-endian)))
(((endian, bi-)))

[NOTE]
====
We originally chose little-endian byte ordering for the RISC-V memory
system because little-endian systems are currently dominant commercially
(all x86 systems; iOS, Android, and Windows for ARM). A minor point is
that we have also found little-endian memory systems to be more natural
for hardware designers. However, certain application areas, such as IP
networking, operate on big-endian data structures, and certain legacy
code bases have been built assuming big-endian processors, so we have
defined big-endian and bi-endian variants of RISC-V.

We have to fix the order in which instruction parcels are stored in
memory, independent of memory system endianness, to ensure that the
length-encoding bits always appear first in halfword address order. This
allows the length of a variable-length instruction to be quickly
determined by an instruction-fetch unit by examining only the first few
bits of the first 16-bit instruction parcel.

We further make the instruction parcels themselves little-endian to
decouple the instruction encoding from the memory system endianness
altogether. This design benefits both software tooling and bi-endian
hardware. Otherwise, for instance, a RISC-V assembler or disassembler
would always need to know the intended active endianness, despite that
in bi-endian systems, the endianness mode might change dynamically
during execution. In contrast, by giving instructions a fixed
endianness, it is sometimes possible for carefully written software to
be endianness-agnostic even in binary form, much like
position-independent code.

The choice to have instructions be only little-endian does have
consequences, however, for RISC-V software that encodes or decodes
machine instructions. Big-endian JIT compilers, for example, must swap
the byte order when storing to instruction memory.

Once we had decided to fix on a little-endian instruction encoding, this
naturally led to placing the length-encoding bits in the LSB positions
of the instruction format to avoid breaking up opcode fields.
====

[[trap-defn]]
=== Exceptions, Traps, and Interrupts

We use the term _exception_ to refer to an unusual condition occurring
at run time associated with an instruction in the current RISC-V hart.
We use the term _interrupt_ to refer to an external asynchronous event
that may cause a RISC-V hart to experience an unexpected transfer of
control. We use the term _trap_ to refer to the transfer of control to a
trap handler caused by either an exception or an interrupt.
(((exceptions)))
(((traps)))
(((interrupts)))

The instruction descriptions in following chapters describe conditions
that can raise an exception during execution. The general behavior of
most RISC-V EEIs is that a trap to some handler occurs when an exception
is signaled on an instruction (except for floating-point exceptions,
which, in the standard floating-point extensions, do not cause traps).
The manner in which interrupts are generated, routed to, and enabled by
a hart depends on the EEI.

[NOTE]
====
Our use of "exception" and "trap" is compatible with that in the
IEEE-754 floating-point standard.

How traps are handled and made visible to software running on the hart
depends on the enclosing execution environment. From the perspective of
software running inside an execution environment, traps encountered by a
hart at runtime can have four different effects:

Contained Trap:::
  The trap is visible to, and handled by, software running inside the
  execution environment. For example, in an EEI providing both
  supervisor and user mode on harts, an ECALL by a user-mode hart will
  generally result in a transfer of control to a supervisor-mode handler
  running on the same hart. Similarly, in the same environment, when a
  hart is interrupted, an interrupt handler will be run in supervisor
  mode on the hart.
Requested Trap:::
  The trap is a synchronous exception that is an explicit call to the
  execution environment requesting an action on behalf of software
  inside the execution environment. An example is a system call. In this
  case, execution may or may not resume on the hart after the requested
  action is taken by the execution environment. For example, a system
  call could remove the hart or cause an orderly termination of the
  entire execution environment.
Invisible Trap:::
  The trap is handled transparently by the execution environment and
  execution resumes normally after the trap is handled. Examples include
  emulating missing instructions, handling non-resident page faults in a
  demand-paged virtual-memory system, or handling device interrupts for
  a different job in a multiprogrammed machine. In these cases, the
  software running inside the execution environment is not aware of the
  trap (we ignore timing effects in these definitions).
Fatal Trap:::
  The trap represents a fatal failure and causes the execution
  environment to terminate execution. Examples include failing a
  virtual-memory page-protection check or allowing a watchdog timer to
  expire. Each EEI should define how execution is terminated and
  reported to an external environment.

^1^ Termination may be requested +
^2^ Imprecise fatal traps might be observable by software

The EEI defines for each trap whether it is handled precisely, though
the recommendation is to maintain preciseness where possible. Contained
and requested traps can be observed to be imprecise by software inside
the execution environment. Invisible traps, by definition, cannot be
observed to be precise or imprecise by software running inside the
execution environment. Fatal traps can be observed to be imprecise by
software running inside the execution environment, if known-errorful
instructions do not cause immediate termination.

Because this document describes unprivileged instructions, traps are
rarely mentioned. Architectural means to handle contained traps are
defined in the privileged architecture manual, along with other features
to support richer EEIs. Unprivileged instructions that are defined
solely to cause requested traps are documented here. Invisible traps
are, by their nature, out of scope for this document. Instruction
encodings that are not defined here and not defined by some other means
may cause a fatal trap.

=== UNSPECIFIED Behaviors and Values
The architecture fully describes what implementations must do and any
constraints on what they may do. In cases where the architecture
intentionally does not constrain implementations, the term UNSPECIFIED is
explicitly used.
(((unspecified, behaviors)))
(((unspecified, values)))

The term UNSPECIFIED refers to a behavior or value that is intentionally
unconstrained. The definition of these behaviors or values is open to
extensions, platform standards, or implementations. Extensions, platform
standards, or implementation documentation may provide normative content
to further constrain cases that the base architecture defines as UNSPECIFIED.

Like the base architecture, extensions should fully describe allowable
behavior and values and use the term UNSPECIFIED for cases that are intentionally
unconstrained. These cases may be constrained or defined by other
extensions, platform standards, or implementations.
