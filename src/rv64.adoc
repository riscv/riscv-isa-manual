== RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set, Version 2.1

This chapter describes the RV64I base integer instruction set, which
builds upon the RV32I variant described in <<rv32>>.
This chapter presents only the differences with RV32I, so should be read
in conjunction with the earlier chapter.

=== Register State

RV64I widens the integer registers and supported user address space to
64 bits (XLEN=64 in <<gprs>>).

=== Integer Computational Instructions

Most integer computational instructions operate on XLEN-bit values.
Additional instruction variants are provided to manipulate 32-bit values
in RV64I, indicated by a 'W' suffix to the opcode. These "*W"
instructions ignore the upper 32 bits of their inputs and always produce
32-bit signed values, sign-extending them to 64 bits, i.e. bits XLEN-1
through 31 are equal.

[NOTE]
====
The compiler and calling convention maintain an invariant that all
32-bit values are held in a sign-extended format in 64-bit registers.
Even 32-bit unsigned integers extend bit 31 into bits 63 through 32.
Consequently, conversion between unsigned and signed 32-bit integers is
a no-op, as is conversion from a signed 32-bit integer to a signed
64-bit integer. Existing 64-bit wide SLTU and unsigned branch compares
still operate correctly on unsigned 32-bit integers under this
invariant. Similarly, existing 64-bit wide logical operations on 32-bit
sign-extended integers preserve the sign-extension property. A few new
instructions (ADD[I]W/SUBW/SxxW) are required for addition and shifts to
ensure reasonable performance for 32-bit values.

==== Integer Register-Immediate Instructions

//.RV64I register-immediate instructions

ADDIW is an RV64I instruction that adds the sign-extended 12-bit
immediate to register _rs1_ and produces the proper sign extension of a
32-bit result in _rd_. Overflows are ignored and the result is the low
32 bits of the result sign-extended to 64 bits. Note, ADDIW _rd, rs1, 0_
writes the sign extension of the lower 32 bits of register _rs1_ into
register _rd_ (assembler pseudoinstruction SEXT.W).

//.RV64I register-immediate (descr ADDIW) instructions

Shifts by a constant are encoded as a specialization of the I-type
format using the same instruction opcode as RV32I. The operand to be
shifted is in _rs1_, and the shift amount is encoded in the lower 6 bits
of the I-immediate field for RV64I. The right shift type is encoded in
bit 30. SLLI is a logical left shift (zeros are shifted into the lower
bits); SRLI is a logical right shift (zeros are shifted into the upper
bits); and SRAI is an arithmetic right shift (the original sign bit is
copied into the vacated upper bits).

SLLIW, SRLIW, and SRAIW are RV64I-only instructions that are analogously
defined but operate on 32-bit values and sign-extend their 32-bit
results to 64 bits. SLLIW, SRLIW, and SRAIW encodings with
_imm[5] &#8800; 0_ are reserved.

[NOTE]
====
Previously, SLLIW, SRLIW, and SRAIW with _imm[5] &#8800; 0_
were defined to cause illegal-instruction exceptions, whereas now they
are marked as reserved. This is a backwards-compatible change.

[[rv64_lui-auipc]]
//.RV64I register-immediate (descr) instructions

LUI (load upper immediate) uses the same opcode as RV32I. LUI places the
32-bit U-immediate into register _rd_, filling in the lowest 12 bits
with zeros. The 32-bit result is sign-extended to 64 bits.
(((RV64I, LUI)))

AUIPC (add upper immediate to `pc`) uses the same opcode as RV32I. AUIPC
is used to build `pc`-relative addresses and uses the U-type format.
AUIPC forms a 32-bit offset from the U-immediate, filling in the lowest
12 bits with zeros, sign-extends the result to 64 bits, adds it to the
address of the AUIPC instruction, then places the result in register
_rd_.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the set of address offsets that can be formed by pairing LUI
with LD, AUIPC with JALR, etc. in RV64I is
[latexmath:[${-}2^{31}{-}2^{11}$], latexmath:[$2^{31}{-}2^{11}{-}1$]].

==== Integer Register-Register Operations

//.RV64I integer register-register instructions

ADDW and SUBW are RV64I-only instructions that are defined analogously
to ADD and SUB but operate on 32-bit values and produce signed 32-bit
results. Overflows are ignored, and the low 32-bits of the result is
sign-extended to 64-bits and written to the destination register.
(((RV64I-only, ADDW)))
(((RV64I-only, SUBW)))

SLL, SRL, and SRA perform logical left, logical right, and arithmetic
right shifts on the value in register _rs1_ by the shift amount held in
register _rs2_. In RV64I, only the low 6 bits of _rs2_ are considered
for the shift amount.

SLLW, SRLW, and SRAW are RV64I-only instructions that are analogously
defined but operate on 32-bit values and sign-extend their 32-bit
results to 64 bits. The shift amount is given by _rs2[4:0]_.

=== Load and Store Instructions

RV64I extends the address space to 64 bits. The execution environment
will define what portions of the address space are legal to access.

include::images/wavedrom/load_store.adoc[]
[[load_store]]
//.Load and store instructions

The LD instruction loads a 64-bit value from memory into register _rd_
for RV64I.
(((RV64I, LD)))

The LW instruction loads a 32-bit value from memory and sign-extends
this to 64 bits before storing it in register _rd_ for RV64I. The LWU
instruction, on the other hand, zero-extends the 32-bit value from
memory for RV64I. LH and LHU are defined analogously for 16-bit values,
as are LB and LBU for 8-bit values. The SD, SW, SH, and SB instructions
store 64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit values from the low bits of
register _rs2_ to memory respectively.

=== HINT Instructions

All instructions that are microarchitectural HINTs in RV32I (see
<<rv32>>) are also HINTs in RV64I.
The additional computational instructions in RV64I expand both the
standard and custom HINT encoding spaces.
(((RV64I, HINT)))

<<rv64i-h>> lists all RV64I HINT code points. 91% of the
HINT space is reserved for standard HINTs, but none are presently
defined. The remainder of the HINT space is designated for custom HINTs;
no standard HINTs will ever be defined in this subspace.
