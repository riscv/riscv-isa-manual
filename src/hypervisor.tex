\chapter{Hypervisor Extension, Version 0.5}
\label{hypervisor}

{\bf Warning! This draft specification is likely to change before being
accepted as standard by the RISC-V Foundation.}

This chapter describes the RISC-V hypervisor extension, which virtualizes the
supervisor-level architecture to support the efficient hosting of guest
operating systems atop a type-1 or type-2 hypervisor.
The hypervisor extension changes supervisor mode into
{\em hypervisor-extended supervisor mode} (HS-mode, or {\em hypervisor
mode} for short), where a hypervisor or a hosting-capable operating system
runs.  The hypervisor extension also adds another level of address translation,
from {\em guest physical addresses} to supervisor physical addresses,
to virtualize the
memory and memory-mapped I/O subsystems for a guest operating system.  HS-mode
acts the same as S-mode, but with additional instructions and CSRs that control
the new level of address translation and support hosting a guest OS in virtual
S-mode (VS-mode).
Regular S-mode operating systems can execute without modification either in
HS-mode or as VS-mode guests.

In HS-mode, an OS or hypervisor interacts with the machine through the same
SBI as an OS normally does from S-mode.  An HS-mode hypervisor is expected to
implement the SBI for its VS-mode guest.

The hypervisor extension is enabled by setting bit 7 in the {\tt misa} CSR,
which corresponds to the letter H.  When {\tt misa}[7] is clear, the hart
behaves as though this extension were not implemented, and attempts to use
hypervisor CSRs or instructions raise an illegal instruction exception.
Implementations that include the hypervisor extension are encouraged
not to hardwire {\tt misa}[7], so that the extension may be disabled.

\begin{commentary}
This draft is based on earlier proposals by John Hauser and Paolo Bonzini.
\end{commentary}

\begin{commentary}
The baseline privileged architecture is designed to simplify the use of classic
virtualization techniques, where a guest OS is run at user-level, as
the few privileged instructions can be easily detected and trapped.
The hypervisor extension improves virtualization performance by
reducing the frequency of these traps.

The hypervisor extension has been designed to be efficiently
emulable on platforms that do not implement the extension, by running
the hypervisor in S-mode and trapping into M-mode for hypervisor CSR accesses
and to maintain shadow page tables.  The majority of CSR accesses for
type-2 hypervisors are valid S-mode accesses so need not be trapped.
Hypervisors can support nested virtualization analogously.
\end{commentary}

\section{Privilege Modes}

The current {\em virtualization mode}, denoted V, indicates whether the hart
is currently executing in a guest.
When V=1, the hart is either in virtual S-mode (VS-mode), or in virtual U-mode
(VU-mode) atop a guest OS running in VS-mode.
When V=0, the hart is either in M-mode, in HS-mode, or in U-mode atop an OS
running in HS-mode.
The virtualization mode also indicates whether two-level address translation
is active (V=1) or inactive (V=0).  Table~\ref{h-operating-modes} lists the
possible operating modes of a RISC-V hart with the hypervisor extension.

\section{Hypervisor and Virtual Supervisor CSRs}

An OS or hypervisor running in HS-mode uses the supervisor CSRs to interact with the exception,
interrupt, and address-translation subsystems.
Additional CSRs are provided to HS-mode, but not to VS-mode, to manage
two-level address translation and to control the behavior of a VS-mode guest:
{\tt hstatus}, {\tt hedeleg}, {\tt hideleg}, {\tt hip}, {\tt hie},
{\tt hcounteren}, {\tt htimedelta}, {\tt htimedeltah}, {\tt htval},
{\tt htinst}, and {\tt hgatp}.

Furthermore, several {\em virtual supervisor} CSRs (VS CSRs) are replicas
of the normal supervisor CSRs.
For example, {\tt vsstatus} is the VS CSR that duplicates the usual
{\tt sstatus} CSR.

When V=1, the VS CSRs substitute for the corresponding supervisor CSRs,
taking over all functions of the usual supervisor CSRs except as specified
otherwise.
Instructions that normally read or modify a supervisor CSR shall instead
access the corresponding VS CSR.
In VS-mode, an attempt to read or write a VS CSR directly by its own
separate CSR address causes an illegal instruction exception.
The VS CSRs can be directly accessed only from M-mode or HS-mode.

While V=1, the normal HS-level supervisor CSRs that are replaced by
VS CSRs retain their values but do
not affect the behavior of the machine unless specifically documented to
do so.
Conversely, when V=0, the VS CSRs do not ordinarily affect the behavior of
the machine other than being readable and writable by CSR instructions.

A few standard supervisor CSRs ({\tt scounteren} and, if the N extension
is implemented, {\tt sedeleg} and {\tt sideleg}) have no matching VS CSR.
These supervisor CSRs continue to have their usual function and
accessibility even when V=1, except with VS-mode and VU-mode substituting for
HS-mode and U-mode.
Hypervisor software is expected to manually swap the contents of these
registers as needed.

\begin{commentary}
Matching VS CSRs exist only for the supervisor CSRs that must be
duplicated, which are mainly those that get automatically written by
traps or that impact instruction execution immediately after trap entry
and/or right before SRET, when software alone is unable to swap a CSR at
exactly the right moment.
Currently, most supervisor CSRs fall into this category, but future ones
might not.
\end{commentary}

In this chapter, we use the term {\em HSXLEN} to refer to the effective XLEN
when executing in HS-mode, and {\em VSXLEN} to refer to the effective
XLEN when executing in VS-mode.

\subsection{Hypervisor Status Register ({\tt hstatus})}

The {\tt hstatus} register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register
formatted as shown in Figure~\ref{hstatusreg-rv32} when HSXLEN=32 and
Figure~\ref{hstatusreg} when HSXLEN=64.
The {\tt hstatus}
register provides facilities analogous to the {\tt mstatus} register
for tracking and controlling the exception behavior of a VS-mode guest.

\end{figure*}

The VSXL field controls the effective XLEN for VS-mode (known as VSXLEN),
which may differ from the XLEN for HS-mode (HSXLEN).
When HSXLEN=32, the VSXL field does not exist, and VSXLEN=32.
When HSXLEN=64, VSXL is a \warl\ field that is encoded the same as the
MXL field of {\tt misa}, shown in Table~\ref{misabase} on
page~\pageref{misabase}.
In particular, the implementation may hardwire VSXL so that VSXLEN=HSXLEN.

If HSXLEN is changed from 32 to a wider width, and if field VSXL is not
hardwired to a forced value, it gets the value corresponding to the
widest supported width not wider than the new HSXLEN.

The {\tt hstatus} fields VTSR and VTVM are defined analogously to the
{\tt mstatus} fields TSR and TVM, but affect the trapping behavior of the SRET
and virtual-memory management instructions only when V=1.

The SPV bit (Supervisor Previous Virtualization Mode) is written by the implementation
whenever a trap is taken into HS-mode.  Just as the SPP bit in {\tt sstatus} is set to the privilege
mode at the time of the trap, the SPV bit in {\tt hstatus} is set to the value of the virtualization
mode V at the time of the trap.  When an SRET instruction is executed when V=0,
V is set to SPV.

When a trap is taken into HS-mode, bits SP2V and SP2P are set to the values
that SPV and the HS-level SPP had before the trap.
When an SRET instruction is executed when V=0, the reverse assignments occur:
after SPV and {\tt sstatus}.SPP have supplied the new virtualization and
privilege modes, they are written with SP2V and SP2P, respectively.

The VSBE bit is a \warl\ field that controls the endianness of explicit
memory accesses made from VS-mode.
If VSBE=0, explicit load and store memory accesses made from VS-mode are
little-endian, and if VSBE=1, they are big-endian.
VSBE also controls the endianness of all implicit accesses to VS-level
memory management data structures, such as page tables.
An implementation may hardwire VSBE to specify always the same endianness
as for HS-mode.

The SPRV bit modifies the privilege of explicit memory accesses made in
HS-mode.
When SPRV=0, translation and protection behave as normal.
When SPRV=1, explicit memory accesses in HS-mode are translated and
protected, and endianness is applied, as though the current
virtualization mode were set to {\tt hstatus}.SPV and the current
privilege mode were set to the HS-level SPP.
Table~\ref{h-sprv} enumerates the cases.

\begin{table*}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||p{4.7in}|}
  \hline
   SPRV & SPV & SPP & Effect \\ \hline \hline
   0    & --  & --  & Normal access; current privilege and virtualization modes apply. \\ \hline
   1    & 0   & 0   & U-level access with HS-level translation and protection only. \\ \hline
   1    & 0   & 1   & HS-level access with HS-level translation and protection only. \\ \hline
   1    & 1   & 0   & VU-level access with two-level translation and protection. The HS-level MXR bit makes any executable page readable.  {\tt vsstatus}.MXR makes readable those pages marked executable at the VS translation level, but only if readable at the guest-physical translation level. \\ \hline
   1    & 1   & 1   & VS-level access with two-level translation and protection. The HS-level MXR bit makes any executable page readable.  {\tt vsstatus}.MXR makes readable those pages marked executable at the VS translation level, but only if readable at the guest-physical translation level.  {\tt vsstatus}.SUM applies instead of the HS-level SUM bit. \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Effect of SPRV on the translation and protection of explicit
memory accesses in HS-mode.}
\label{h-sprv}
\end{table*}

An MRET or SRET instruction that changes the operating mode to U-mode,
VS-mode, or VU-mode also sets SPRV=0.

\subsection{Hypervisor Trap Delegation Registers ({\tt hedeleg} and {\tt hideleg})}

Registers {\tt hedeleg} and {\tt hideleg} are HSXLEN-bit read/write
registers, formatted as shown in Figures \ref{hedelegreg} and
\ref{hidelegreg} respectively.
By default, all traps at any privilege level are handled in M-mode, though
M-mode usually uses the {\tt medeleg} and {\tt mideleg} CSRs to delegate
some traps to HS-mode.  The {\tt hedeleg} and {\tt hideleg} CSRs allow these
traps to be further delegated to a VS-mode guest; their layout is the same
as {\tt medeleg} and {\tt mideleg}.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Bits of {\tt hedeleg} that must be writable or must be hardwired
to zero.}
\label{tab:hedeleg-bits}
\end{table*}

A synchronous trap that has been delegated to HS-mode (using
{\tt medeleg}) is further delegated to VS-mode if V=1 before the trap and
the corresponding {\tt hedeleg} bit is set.
Each bit of {\tt hedeleg} shall be either writable or hardwired to zero.
Many bits of {\tt hedeleg} are required specifically to be writable or
zero, as enumerated in Table~\ref{tab:hedeleg-bits}.
Bit~0, corresponding to instruction address misaligned exceptions, must
be writable if IALIGN=32.

\begin{commentary}
Requiring that certain bits of {\tt hedeleg} be writable reduces some of
the burden on a hypervisor to handle variations of implementation.
\end{commentary}

An interrupt that has been delegated to HS-mode (using {\tt mideleg}) is
further delegated to VS-mode if the corresponding {\tt hideleg} bit is
set.
Among bits 15:0 of {\tt hideleg}, only bits 10, 6, and 2 (corresponding
to the standard VS-level interrupts) shall be writable, and the others
shall be hardwired to zero.

When a virtual supervisor external interrupt (code 10) is delegated to
VS-mode, it is automatically translated by the machine into a supervisor
external interrupt (code 9) for VS-mode, including the value written to
{\tt vscause} on an interrupt trap.
Likewise, a virtual supervisor timer interrupt (6) is translated into a
supervisor timer interrupt (5) for VS-mode, and a virtual supervisor
software interrupt (2) is translated into a supervisor software interrupt
(1) for VS-mode.
Similar translations may or may not be done for platform or custom
interrupt causes (codes 16 and above).

\subsection{Hypervisor Interrupt Registers ({\tt hip} and {\tt hie})}
\label{sec:hinterruptregs}

Registers {\tt hip} and {\tt hie} are HSXLEN-bit read/write registers
that supplement HS-level's {\tt sip} and {\tt sie} respectively.
The {\tt hip} register indicates pending VS-level interrupts, while
{\tt hie} contains enable bits for VS-level interrupts.
Like {\tt sip} and {\tt sie}, interrupt cause number \textit{i}
corresponds with bit~\textit{i} in both {\tt hip} and {\tt hie}.

\vspace{-0.1in}
\caption{Hypervisor interrupt-enable register ({\tt hie}).}
\label{hiereg}
\end{figure}

For each writable bit in {\tt sie}, the corresponding bit shall be
hardwired to zero in both {\tt hip} and {\tt hie}.
Hence, the nonzero bits in {\tt sie} and {\tt hie} are always mutually
exclusive, and likewise for {\tt sip} and {\tt hip}.

\begin{commentary}
The active bits of {\tt hip} and {\tt hie} cannot be placed in HS-level's
{\tt sip} and {\tt sie} because doing so would make it impossible for
software to emulate the hypervisor extension on platforms that do not
implement it in hardware.
\end{commentary}

If bit~\textit{i} of {\tt sie} is hardwired to zero, the same bit in
register {\tt hip} may be writable or may be read-only.
When bit~\textit{i} in {\tt hip} is writable, a pending interrupt
\textit{i} can be cleared by writing 0 to this bit.
If interrupt \textit{i} can become pending in {\tt hip} but
bit~\textit{i} in {\tt hip} is read-only, the implementation must provide
some other mechanism for clearing the pending interrupt (which may
involve a call to the execution environment).

A bit in {\tt hie} shall be writable if the corresponding interrupt can
ever become pending in {\tt hip}.
Bits of {\tt hie} that are not writable shall be hardwired to zero.

The standard portions (bits 15:0) of registers {\tt hip} and {\tt hie}
are formatted as shown in Figures \ref{hipreg-standard} and
\ref{hiereg-standard} respectively.

\label{hiereg-standard}
\end{figure*}

Bits {\tt hip}.VSEIP and {\tt hie}.VSEIE are the interrupt-pending and
interrupt-enable bits for VS-level external interrupts.
VSEIP is writable in {\tt hip}, and may be written by a hypervisor to
indicate to VS-mode that an external interrupt is pending.
Additionally, the platform-level interrupt controller may generate
VS-level external interrupts.
VS-level external interrupts are made pending based on the logical-OR of
the software-writable VSEIP bit and the signal from the external
interrupt controller.
When {\tt hip} is read with a CSR instruction, the value of the VSEIP bit
returned in the {\tt rd} destination register is the logical-OR of the
software-writable bit and the interrupt signal from the interrupt
controller.
However, the value used in the read-modify-write sequence of a CSRRS or
CSRRC instruction contains only the software-writable VSEIP bit, ignoring
the interrupt value from the external interrupt controller.

\begin{commentary}
The VSEIP field behavior is designed to allow a hypervisor to mimic
external interrupts cleanly for a guest virtual machine, without losing
any real external interrupts that may be directed to VS-level.
The behavior of the CSR instructions is slightly modified from regular
CSR accesses as a result.
This modified CSR behavior for VSEIP is the same as given to
{\tt mip}.SEIP for like reason.
\end{commentary}

Bits {\tt hip}.VSTIP and {\tt hie}.VSTIE are the interrupt-pending and
interrupt-enable bits for VS-level timer interrupts.
VSTIP is writable in {\tt hip}, and may be written by a hypervisor to
deliver timer interrupts to VS-mode.

Bits {\tt hip}.VSSIP and {\tt hie}.VSSIE are the interrupt-pending and
interrupt-enable bits for VS-level software interrupts.
VSSIP is writable in {\tt hip}.

Multiple simultaneous interrupts destined for HS-mode are handled in the
following decreasing priority order:  SEI, SSI, STI, VSEI, VSSI, VSTI.

\subsection{Hypervisor Counter-Enable Register ({\tt hcounteren})}

The counter-enable register {\tt hcounteren} is a 32-bit register that
controls the availability of the hardware performance monitoring counters
to the guest virtual machine.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\caption{Hypervisor counter-enable register ({\tt hcounteren}).}
\label{hcounteren}
\end{figure*}

When the CY, TM, IR, or HPM{\em n} bit in the {\tt hcounteren} register
is clear, attempts to read the {\tt cycle}, {\tt time}, {\tt instret}, or
{\tt hpmcounter}{\em n} register while V=1 will cause an illegal
instruction exception.
When one of these bits is set, access to the corresponding register is
permitted when V=1, unless prevented for some other reason.
In VU-mode, a counter is not readable unless the applicable bits are set
in both {\tt hcounteren} and {\tt scounteren}.

{\tt hcounteren} must be implemented.
However, any of the bits may contain a hardwired value of zero,
indicating reads to the corresponding counter will cause an exception
when V=1.
Hence, they are effectively \warl\ fields.

\subsection{Hypervisor Time Delta Registers ({\tt htimedelta}, {\tt htimedeltah})}

The {\tt htimedelta} CSR is a read/write register that contains the delta
between the value of the {\tt time} CSR and the value returned in VS-mode or
VU-mode.
That is, reading the {\tt time} CSR in VS or VU mode returns the sum of the
contents of {\tt htimedelta} and the actual value of {\tt time}.

\subsection{Hypervisor Trap Value Register ({\tt htval})}

The {\tt htval} register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register formatted
as shown in Figure~\ref{htvalreg}.
When a trap is taken into HS-mode, {\tt htval} is written with additional
exception-specific information, alongside {\tt stval}, to assist software
in handling the trap.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\caption{Hypervisor trap value register ({\tt htval}).}
\label{htvalreg}
\end{figure*}

When a guest-page-fault trap is taken into HS-mode, {\tt htval} is
written with either zero or the guest physical address that faulted,
shifted right by 2~bits.
For other traps, {\tt htval} is set to zero, but a future standard or
extension may redefine {\tt htval}'s setting for other traps.

For misaligned loads and stores that cause guest-page faults, {\tt htval}
will contain zero or the guest physical address of the portion of the
access that caused the fault.
For instruction guest-page faults on systems with variable-length
instructions, {\tt htval} will contain zero or the guest physical address
of the portion of the instruction that caused the fault.

\begin{commentary}
The least-significant two bits of a faulting guest physical address are
not available in {\tt htval}.
If needed, these bits are ordinarily the same as the least-significant
two bits of the faulting virtual address in {\tt stval}.
For faults due to implicit memory accesses for VS-level address
translation, the least-significant two bits are instead zeros.
These cases can be distinguished using the value provided in register
{\tt htinst}.
\end{commentary}

{\tt htval} is a \warl\ register that must be able to hold zero and may
be capable of holding only an arbitrary subset of other 2-bit-shifted
guest physical addresses, if any.

\begin{commentary}
Unless it has reason to assume otherwise (such as a platform standard),
software that writes a value to {\tt htval} should read back from
{\tt htval} to confirm the stored value.
\end{commentary}

\subsection{Hypervisor Trap Instruction Register ({\tt htinst})}

The {\tt htinst} register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register formatted
as shown in Figure~\ref{htinstreg}.
When a trap is taken into HS-mode, {\tt htinst} is written with a value
that, if nonzero, provides information about the instruction that
trapped, to assist software in handling the trap.
The values that may be written to {\tt htinst} on a trap are documented
in Section~\ref{sec:tinst-vals}.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

\end{center}
}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\caption{Hypervisor trap instruction register ({\tt htinst}).}
\label{htinstreg}
\end{figure*}

{\tt htinst} is a \warl\ register that need only be able to hold the
values that the implementation may automatically write to it on a trap.

\subsection{Hypervisor Guest Address Translation and Protection Register ({\tt hgatp})}
\label{sec:hgatp}

The {\tt hgatp} register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register, formatted as
shown in Figure~\ref{rv32hgatp} for HSXLEN=32 and Figure~\ref{rv64hgatp} for
HSXLEN=64, which controls guest physical address translation and protection.
Similar to CSR {\tt satp}, this register holds the physical page number (PPN)
of the guest-physical root page table; a virtual machine identifier (VMID),
which facilitates address-translation fences on a per-virtual-machine basis;
and the MODE field, which selects the address-translation scheme for guest
physical addresses.
When {\tt mstatus}.TVM=1, attempts to read or write {\tt hgatp} while executing
in HS-mode will raise an illegal instruction exception.

\caption{RV64 Hypervisor guest address translation and protection register
{\tt hgatp}, for MODE values Bare, Sv39x4, and Sv48x4.}
\label{rv64hgatp}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:hgatp-mode} shows the encodings of the MODE field for RV32 and
RV64.
When MODE=Bare, guest physical addresses are equal to supervisor physical
addresses, and there is no further memory protection for a guest virtual
machine beyond the physical memory protection scheme described in
Section~\ref{sec:pmp}.
In this case, the remaining fields in {\tt hgatp} must be set to zeros.

For RV32, the only other valid setting for MODE is Sv32x4, which is a
modification of the usual Sv32 paged virtual-memory scheme, extended to support
34-bit guest physical addresses.
For RV64, modes Sv39x4 and Sv48x4 are defined as modifications of the Sv39 and
Sv48 paged virtual-memory schemes.
All of these paged virtual-memory schemes are described in
Section~\ref{sec:guest-addr-translation}.
An additional RV64 scheme, Sv57x4, may be defined in a later version of this
specification.

The remaining MODE settings for RV64 are reserved for future use and may define
different interpretations of the other fields in {\tt hgatp}.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Encoding of {\tt hgatp} MODE field.}
\label{tab:hgatp-mode}
\end{table}

RV64 implementations are not required to support all defined RV64 MODE
settings.

A write to {\tt hgatp} with an unsupported MODE value is not ignored as it is
for {\tt satp}.
Instead, the fields of {\tt hgatp} are {\warl} in the normal way, when so
indicated.

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:guest-addr-translation}, for the paged
virtual-memory schemes (Sv32x4, Sv39x4, and Sv48x4), the root page table is
16~KiB and must be aligned to a 16-KiB boundary.
In these modes, the lowest two bits of the physical page number (PPN) in
{\tt hgatp} always read as zeros.
An implementation that supports only the defined paged virtual-memory schemes
and/or Bare may hardwire PPN[1:0] to zero.

The number of VMID bits is \unspecified\ and may be zero.
The number of implemented VMID bits, termed {\mbox {\em VMIDLEN}}, may be
determined by writing one to every bit position in the VMID field, then reading
back the value in {\tt hgatp} to see which bit positions in the VMID field hold
a one.
The least-significant bits of VMID are implemented first:
that is, if VMIDLEN~$>$~0, VMID[VMIDLEN-1:0] is writable.
The maximal value of VMIDLEN, termed VMIDMAX, is 7 for Sv32x4 or 14 for Sv39x4
and Sv48x4.

Note that writing {\tt hgatp} does not imply any ordering constraints between
page-table updates and subsequent guest physical address translations.
If the new virtual machine's guest physical page tables have been modified, it
may be necessary to execute an HFENCE.GVMA instruction
(see Section~\ref{sec:hfence.vma}) before or after writing {\tt hgatp}.

\subsection{Virtual Supervisor Status Register ({\tt vsstatus})}

The {\tt vsstatus} register is a VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is
VS-mode's version of supervisor register {\tt sstatus}, formatted as
shown in Figure~\ref{vsstatusreg} when VSXLEN=32 and
Figure~\ref{vsstatusreg} when VSXLEN=64.
When V=1, {\tt vsstatus} substitutes for the usual {\tt sstatus}, so
instructions that normally read or modify {\tt sstatus} actually access
{\tt vsstatus} instead.

\end{figure*}

The UXL field controls the effective XLEN for VU-mode, which may differ
from the XLEN for VS-mode (VSXLEN).
When VSXLEN=32, the UXL field does not exist, and VU-mode XLEN=32.
When VSXLEN=64, UXL is a \warl\ field that is encoded the same as the MXL
field of {\tt misa}, shown in Table~\ref{misabase} on
page~\pageref{misabase}.
In particular, the implementation may hardwire field UXL so that VU-mode
XLEN=VSXLEN.

If VSXLEN is changed from 32 to a wider width, and if field UXL is not
hardwired to a forced value, it gets the value corresponding to the
widest supported width not wider than the new VSXLEN.

When V=1, both {\tt vsstatus}.FS and the HS-level {\tt sstatus}.FS are in
effect.  Attempts
to execute a floating-point instruction when either field is 0 (Off) raise an
illegal-instruction exception.  Modifying the floating-point state when V=1
causes both fields to be set to 3 (Dirty).

\begin{commentary}
For a hypervisor to benefit from the extension context status, it must
have its own copy in the HS-level {\tt sstatus}, maintained independently
of a guest OS running in VS-mode.
While a version of the extension context status obviously must exist in
{\tt vsstatus} for VS-mode, a hypervisor cannot rely on this version
being maintained correctly, given that VS-level software can change
{\tt vsstatus}.FS arbitrarily.
If the HS-level {\tt sstatus}.FS were not independently active and
maintained by the hardware in parallel with {\tt vsstatus}.FS while V=1,
hypervisors would always be forced to conservatively swap all
floating-point state when context-switching between virtual machines.
\end{commentary}

Read-only fields SD and XS summarize the extension context status as it
is visible to VS-mode only.
For example, the value of the HS-level {\tt sstatus}.FS does not affect
{\tt vsstatus}.SD.

An implementation may hardwire field UBE to be always the same as
{\tt hstatus}.VSBE.

When V=0, {\tt vsstatus} does not directly affect the behavior of the machine,
unless the MPRV feature in the {\tt mstatus} register or the SPRV feature
in the {\tt hstatus} register is used to execute a load or store
{\em as though} V=1.

\subsection{Virtual Supervisor Interrupt Registers ({\tt vsip} and {\tt vsie})}

The {\tt vsip} and {\tt vsie} registers are VSXLEN-bit read/write
registers that are VS-mode's versions of supervisor CSRs {\tt sip} and
{\tt sie}, formatted as shown in Figures \ref{vsipreg} and \ref{vsiereg}
respectively.
When V=1, {\tt vsip} and {\tt vsie} substitute for the usual {\tt sip}
and {\tt sie}, so instructions that normally read or modify
{\tt sip}/{\tt sie} actually access {\tt vsip}/{\tt vsie} instead.
However, interrupts directed to HS-level continue to be
indicated in the HS-level {\tt sip} register, not in {\tt vsip}, when
V=1.

When V=0, a write to {\tt vsatp} with an unsupported MODE value is not
ignored as it is for {\tt satp}.
Instead, the fields of {\tt vsatp} are {\warl} in the normal way.

When V=0, {\tt vsatp} does not directly affect the behavior of the machine,
unless the MPRV feature in the {\tt mstatus} register or the SPRV feature
in the {\tt hstatus} register is used to execute a load or store
{\em as though} V=1.

\section{Hypervisor Instructions}

The hypervisor extension adds two privileged fence instructions.

\subsection{Hypervisor Memory-Management Fence Instructions}
\label{sec:hfence.vma}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{O@{}R@{}R@{}F@{}R@{}S}
\\
\instbitrange{31}{25} &
\instbitrange{24}{20} &
\instbitrange{19}{15} &

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The hypervisor memory-management fence instructions, HFENCE.GVMA and
HFENCE.VVMA, are valid only in HS-mode when {\tt mstatus}.TVM=0, or in M-mode
(irrespective of {\tt mstatus}.TVM).
These instructions perform a function similar to SFENCE.VMA
(Section~\ref{sec:sfence.vma}), except applying to the guest-physical
memory-management data structures controlled by CSR {\tt hgatp} (HFENCE.GVMA)
or the VS-level memory-management data structures controlled by CSR {\tt vsatp}
(HFENCE.VVMA).
Instruction SFENCE.VMA applies only to the memory-management data structures
controlled by the current {\tt satp} (either the HS-level {\tt satp} when
V=0 or {\tt vsatp} when V=1).

If an HFENCE.VVMA instruction executes without trapping, its effect is much the
same as temporarily entering VS-mode and executing SFENCE.VMA.
Executing an HFENCE.VVMA guarantees that any previous stores already visible
to the current hart are ordered before all subsequent implicit reads by that
hart of the VS-level memory-management data structures, when those implicit
reads are for instructions that
\begin{compactitem}
\item
are subsequent to the HFENCE.VVMA, and
\item
execute when {\tt hgatp}.VMID has the same setting as it did when HFENCE.VVMA
executed.
\end{compactitem}
Implicit reads need not be ordered when {\tt hgatp}.VMID is different than at
the time HFENCE.VVMA executed.
If operand {\em rs1}$\neq${\tt x0}, it specifies a single guest virtual
address, and if operand {\em rs2}$\neq${\tt x0}, it specifies a single guest
address-space identifier
(ASID).

\begin{commentary}
An HFENCE.VVMA instruction applies only to a single virtual machine, identified
by the setting of {\tt hgatp}.VMID when HFENCE.VVMA executes.
\end{commentary}

When {\em rs2}$\neq${\tt x0}, bits XLEN-1:ASIDMAX of the value held in {\em
rs2} are reserved for future use and should be zeroed by software and ignored
by current implementations.
Furthermore, if ASIDLEN~$<$~ASIDMAX, the implementation shall ignore bits
ASIDMAX-1:ASIDLEN of the value held in {\em rs2}.

\begin{commentary}
Simpler implementations of HFENCE.VVMA can ignore the guest virtual address in
{\em rs1} and the guest ASID value in {\em rs2}, as well as {\tt hgatp}.VMID,
and always perform a global fence for the VS-level memory management of all
virtual machines, or even a global fence for all memory-management data
structures.
\end{commentary}

Executing an HFENCE.GVMA instruction guarantees that any previous stores
already visible to the current hart are ordered before all subsequent implicit
reads by that hart of guest-physical memory-management data structures done for instructions
that follow the HFENCE.GVMA.
If operand {\em rs1}$\neq${\tt x0}, it specifies a single guest physical
address, shifted right by 2~bits, and if operand {\em rs2}$\neq${\tt x0}, it
specifies a single virtual machine identifier (VMID).

\begin{commentary}
For HFENCE.GVMA, a guest physical address specified in {\em rs1} is shifted
right by 2~bits to accommodate addresses wider than the current XLEN.
For RV32, the hypervisor extension permits guest physical addresses as wide as
34 bits, and {\em rs1} specifies bits 33:2 of such an address.
This shift-by-2 encoding of guest physical addresses matches the encoding of
physical addresses in PMP address registers (Section~\ref{sec:pmp}) and in page
table entries (Sections \ref{sec:sv32}, \ref{sec:sv39}, and~\ref{sec:sv48}).
\end{commentary}

When {\em rs2}$\neq${\tt x0}, bits XLEN-1:VMIDMAX of the value held in {\em
rs2} are reserved for future use and should be zeroed by software and ignored
by current implementations.
Furthermore, if VMIDLEN~$<$~VMIDMAX, the implementation shall ignore bits
VMIDMAX-1:VMIDLEN of the value held in {\em rs2}.

\begin{commentary}
Simpler implementations of HFENCE.GVMA can ignore the guest physical address in
{\em rs1} and the VMID value in {\em rs2} and always perform a global fence for
the guest-physical memory management of all virtual machines, or even a global
fence for all memory-management data structures.
\end{commentary}

\section{Machine-Level CSRs}

The hypervisor extension augments or modifies machine CSRs {\tt mstatus},
{\tt mstatush}, {\tt mideleg}, {\tt mip}, and {\tt mie}, and
adds CSRs {\tt mtval2} and {\tt mtinst}.

\subsection{Machine Status Registers ({\tt mstatus} and {\tt mstatush})}

The hypervisor extension adds one field, MPV, to the
machine-level {\tt mstatus} or {\tt mstatush} CSR, and modifies the
behavior of several existing {\tt mstatus} fields.
Figure~\ref{hypervisor-mstatus} shows the modified {\tt mstatus} register
when the hypervisor extension is implemented and MXLEN=64.
When MXLEN=32, the hypervisor extension adds MPV not to {\tt mstatus}
but to {\tt mstatush}, which must exist.
Figure~\ref{hypervisor-mstatush} shows the {\tt mstatush} register when
the hypervisor extension is implemented and MXLEN=32.

\label{hypervisor-mstatush}
\end{figure*}

The MPV bit (Machine Previous Virtualization Mode) is written by the implementation
whenever a trap is taken into M-mode.  Just as the MPP bit is set to the privilege
mode at the time of the trap, the MPV bit is set to the value of the virtualization
mode V at the time of the trap.  When an MRET instruction is executed, the
virtualization mode V is set to MPV, unless MPP=3, in which case V remains 0.

The TSR and TVM fields of {\tt mstatus} affect execution only in HS-mode,
not in VS-mode.
The TW field affects execution in all modes except M-mode.

\begin{table*}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||p{4.5in}|}
  \hline
   MPRV & MPV & MPP & Effect \\ \hline \hline
   0    & --  & --  & Normal access; current privilege and virtualization modes apply. \\ \hline
   1    & 0   & 0   & U-level access with HS-level translation and protection only. \\ \hline
   1    & 0   & 1   & HS-level access with HS-level translation and protection only.  \\ \hline
   1    & --  & 3   & M-level access with no translation. \\ \hline
   1    & 1   & 0   & VU-level access with two-level translation and protection. The HS-level MXR bit makes any executable page readable.  {\tt vsstatus}.MXR makes readable those pages marked executable at the VS translation level, but only if readable at the guest-physical translation level. \\ \hline
   1    & 1   & 1   & VS-level access with two-level translation and protection. The HS-level MXR bit makes any executable page readable.  {\tt vsstatus}.MXR makes readable those pages marked executable at the VS translation level, but only if readable at the guest-physical translation level.  {\tt vsstatus}.SUM applies instead of the HS-level SUM bit. \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Effect of MPRV on the translation and protection of explicit
memory accesses.

privilege is further modified: {\tt hstatus}.SPV applies instead of MPV,
and the HS-level SPP applies instead of MPP.}
\label{h-mprv}
\end{table*}

The hypervisor extension changes the behavior of the the Modify Privilege
field, MPRV, of {\tt mstatus}.
When MPRV=0, translation and protection behave as normal.
When MPRV=1, explicit memory accesses are translated and protected, and
endianness is applied, as though the current virtualization mode were set
to MPV and the current privilege mode were set to MPP.
Table~\ref{h-mprv} enumerates the cases.

The {\tt mstatus} register is a superset of the HS-level {\tt sstatus}
register but is not a superset of {\tt vsstatus}.

\subsection{Machine Interrupt Delegation Register ({\tt mideleg})}

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, bits 10, 6, and 2 of
{\tt mideleg} (corresponding to the standard VS-level interrupts) are
each hardwired to one.
VS-level interrupts are always delegated past M-mode to HS-mode.

\subsection{Machine Interrupt Registers ({\tt mip} and {\tt mie})}

The hypervisor extension gives registers {\tt mip} and {\tt mie}
additional active bits for VS-level interrupts.
Figures \ref{hypervisor-mipreg-standard} and
\ref{hypervisor-miereg-standard} show the standard portions (bits 15:0)
of registers {\tt mip} and {\tt mie} when the hypervisor extension is
implemented.

Bits VSEIP, VSTIP, and VSSIP in {\tt mip} are aliases for the same bits

Instructions CSRRS and CSRRC have the same modified behavior for bit
VSEIP in {\tt mip} as they do for VSEIP in {\tt hip}, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:hinterruptregs}.
There is only one software-writable VSEIP bit, accessible through either
{\tt mip} or {\tt hip}.

\subsection{Machine Second Trap Value Register ({\tt mtval2})}

The {\tt mtval2} register is an MXLEN-bit read/write register formatted
as shown in Figure~\ref{mtval2reg}.
When a trap is taken into M-mode, {\tt mtval2} is written with additional
exception-specific information, alongside {\tt mtval}, to assist software
in handling the trap.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

\begin{center}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\caption{Machine second trap value register ({\tt mtval2}).}
\label{mtval2reg}
\end{figure*}

When a guest-page-fault trap is taken into M-mode, {\tt mtval2} is
written with either zero or the guest physical address that faulted,
shifted right by 2~bits.
For other traps, {\tt mtval2} is set to zero, but a future standard or
extension may redefine {\tt mtval2}'s setting for other traps.

For misaligned loads and stores that cause guest-page faults,
{\tt mtval2} will contain zero or the guest physical address of the
portion of the access that caused the fault.
For instruction guest-page faults on systems with variable-length
instructions, {\tt mtval2} will contain zero or the guest physical
address of the portion of the instruction that caused the fault.

{\tt mtval2} is a \warl\ register that must be able to hold zero and may
be capable of holding only an arbitrary subset of other 2-bit-shifted
guest physical addresses, if any.

\subsection{Machine Trap Instruction Register ({\tt mtinst})}

The {\tt mtinst} register is an MXLEN-bit read/write register formatted
as shown in Figure~\ref{mtinstreg}.
When a trap is taken into M-mode, {\tt mtinst} is written with a value
that, if nonzero, provides information about the instruction that
trapped, to assist software in handling the trap.
The values that may be written to {\tt mtinst} on a trap are documented
in Section~\ref{sec:tinst-vals}.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\caption{Machine trap instruction register ({\tt mtinst}).}
\label{mtinstreg}
\end{figure*}

{\tt mtinst} is a \warl\ register that need only be able to hold the
values that the implementation may automatically write to it on a trap.

\section{Two-Level Address Translation}
\label{sec:two-level-translation}

Whenever the current virtualization mode V is 1 (and assuming
{\tt mstatus}.MPRV=0), two-level address translation and protection is in
effect.
For any virtual memory access, the original virtual address is first converted
by VS-level address translation, as controlled by the {\tt vsatp}
register, into a {\em guest physical address}.
The guest physical address is then converted by guest physical address
translation, as controlled by the {\tt hgatp} register, into a supervisor
physical address.
Although there is no option to disable two-level address translation when V=1,
either level of translation can be effectively disabled by zeroing the
corresponding {\tt vsatp} or {\tt hgatp} register.

The {\tt vsstatus} field MXR, which makes execute-only pages readable, only
overrides VS-level page protection.
Setting MXR at VS-level does not override guest-physical page protections.
Setting MXR at HS-level, however, overrides both VS-level and guest-physical
execute-only permissions.

When V=1, memory accesses that would normally bypass address translation are
subject to guest physical address translation alone.
This includes memory accesses made in support of VS-level address translation,
such as reads and writes of VS-level page tables.

Machine-level physical memory protection applies to supervisor physical
addresses and is in effect regardless of virtualization mode.

\subsection{Guest Physical Address Translation}
\label{sec:guest-addr-translation}

The mapping of guest physical addresses to supervisor physical addresses is
controlled by CSR {\tt hgatp} (Section~\ref{sec:hgatp}).

When the address translation scheme selected by the MODE field of {\tt hgatp}
is Bare, guest physical addresses are equal to supervisor physical addresses
without modification, and no memory protection applies in the trivial
translation of guest physical addresses to supervisor physical addresses.

When {\tt hgatp}.MODE specifies a translation scheme of Sv32x4, Sv39x4, or
Sv48x4, guest physical address translation is a variation on the usual
page-based virtual address translation scheme of Sv32, Sv39, or Sv48,
respectively.
In each case, the size of the incoming address is widened by 2~bits (to 34, 41,
or 50 bits).
To accommodate the 2~extra bits, the root page table (only) is expanded by a
factor of four to be 16~KiB instead of the usual 4~KiB.
Matching its larger size, the root page table also must be aligned to a 16~KiB
boundary instead of the usual 4~KiB page boundary.
Except as noted, all other aspects of Sv32, Sv39, or Sv48 are adopted unchanged
for guest physical address translation.
Non-root page tables and all page table entries (PTEs) have the same formats as
documented in Sections \ref{sec:sv32}, \ref{sec:sv39}, and~\ref{sec:sv48}.

For Sv32x4, an incoming guest physical address is partitioned into a virtual
page number (VPN) and page offset as shown in Figure~\ref{sv32x4va}.
This partitioning is identical to that for an Sv32 virtual address as depicted
in Figure~\ref{sv32va} (page~\pageref{sv32va}), except with 2 more bits at the
high end in VPN[1].
(Note that the fields of a partitioned guest physical address also correspond
one-for-one with the structure that Sv32 assigns to a physical address,
depicted in Figure~\ref{rv32va}.)

\label{sv48x4va}
\end{figure*}

\begin{commentary}
The page-based guest physical address translation scheme for RV32, Sv32x4, is
defined to support a 34-bit guest physical address so that an RV32 hypervisor
need not be limited in its ability to virtualize real 32-bit RISC-V machines,
even those with 33-bit or 34-bit physical addresses.
This may include the possibility of a machine virtualizing itself, if it
happens to use 33-bit or 34-bit physical addresses.
Multiplying the size and alignment of the root page table by a factor of four
is the cheapest way to extend Sv32 to cover a 34-bit address.
The possible wastage of 12~KiB for an unnecessarily large root page table is
expected to be of negligible consequence for most (maybe all) real uses.

A consistent ability to virtualize machines having as much as four times the
physical address space as virtual address space is believed to be of some
utility also for RV64.
For a machine implementing 39-bit virtual addresses (Sv39), for example, this
allows the hypervisor extension to support up to a 41-bit guest physical
address space without either necessitating hardware support for 48-bit virtual
addresses (Sv48) or falling back to emulating the larger address space using
shadow page tables.
\end{commentary}

The conversion of an Sv32x4, Sv39x4, or Sv48x4 guest physical address is
accomplished with the same algorithm used for Sv32, Sv39, or Sv48, as presented
in Section~\ref{sv32algorithm}, except that:
\begin{compactitem}
\item
in step~1, $a = \mbox{{\tt hgatp}.PPN}\times\mbox{PAGESIZE}$;
\item
the current privilege mode is always taken to be U-mode; and
\item
guest-page-fault exceptions are raised instead of regular page-fault
exceptions.
\end{compactitem}

For guest physical address translation, all memory accesses (including those
made to access data structures for VS-level address translation) are considered
to be user-level accesses, as though executed in U-mode.
Access type permissions---readable, writable, or executable---are checked
during guest physical address translation the same as for VS-level address
translation.
For a memory access made to support VS-level address translation (such as to
read/write a VS-level page table), permissions are checked as though for a load
or store, not for the original access type.
However, any exception is always reported for the original access type
(instruction, load, or store/AMO).

\begin{commentary}
Guest physical address translation uses the identical format for PTEs as
regular address translation, even including the U~bit, due to the
possibility of sharing some (or all) page tables between guest physical
address translation and regular HS-level address translation.
Regardless of whether this usage will ever become common, we chose not to
preclude it.
\end{commentary}

\subsection{Guest-Page Faults}

Guest-page-fault traps may be delegated from M-mode to HS-mode under the
control of CSR {\tt medeleg}, but cannot be delegated to other operating
modes.
On a guest-page fault, CSR {\tt mtval} or {\tt stval} is written with the
faulting guest virtual address as usual, and {\tt mtval2} or {\tt htval} is
written either with zero or with the faulting guest physical address,
shifted right by 2~bits.
CSR {\tt mtinst} or {\tt htinst} may also be written with information
about the faulting instruction or other reason for the access, as
explained in Section~\ref{sec:tinst-vals}.

When an instruction fetch or a misaligned memory access straddles a page
boundary, two different address translations are involved.
When a guest-page fault occurs in such a circumstance, the faulting
virtual address written to {\tt mtval}/{\tt stval} is the same as would
be required for a regular page fault.
Thus, the faulting virtual address may be a page-boundary address that is
higher than the instruction's original virtual address, if the byte at
that page boundary is among the accessed bytes.
A nonzero guest physical address written by the machine to
{\tt mtval2}/{\tt htval}
shall always correspond to the exact guest virtual address written to
{\tt mtval}/{\tt stval}.

\subsection{Memory-Management Fences}

The behavior of the SFENCE.VMA instruction is affected by the current
virtualization mode V.  When V=0, the virtual-address argument is an HS-level
virtual address, and the ASID argument is an HS-level ASID.
The instruction orders stores only to HS-level address-translation structures
with subsequent HS-level address translations.

When V=1, the virtual-address argument to SFENCE.VMA is a guest virtual
address within the current virtual machine, and the ASID argument is a VS-level
ASID within the current virtual machine.
The current virtual machine is identified by the VMID field of CSR {\tt hgatp},
and the effective ASID can be considered to be the combination of this VMID
with the VS-level ASID.
The SFENCE.VMA instruction orders stores only to the VS-level
address-translation structures with subsequent VS-level address translations
for the same virtual machine, i.e., only when {\tt hgatp}.VMID is the same as
when the SFENCE.VMA executed.

Hypervisor instructions HFENCE.GVMA and HFENCE.VVMA provide additional
memory-management fences to complement SFENCE.VMA.
These instructions are described in Section~\ref{sec:hfence.vma}.

Section~\ref{pmp-vmem} discusses the intersection between physical memory
protection (PMP) and page-based address translation.
It is noted there that, when PMP settings are modified in a manner that affects
either the physical memory that holds page tables or the physical memory to
which page tables point, M-mode software must synchronize the PMP settings with
the virtual memory system.
For HS-level address translation, this is accomplished by executing in M-mode
an SFENCE.VMA instruction with {\em rs1}={\tt x0} and {\em rs2}={\tt x0}, after
the PMP CSRs are written.
If guest physical address translation is in use, synchronization with its data
structures is also needed.
When PMP settings are modified in a manner that affects either the physical
memory that holds guest-physical page tables or the physical memory to which
guest-physical page tables point, an HFENCE.GVMA instruction with
{\em rs1}={\tt x0} and {\em rs2}={\tt x0} must be executed in M-mode after the
PMP CSRs are written.
An HFENCE.VVMA instruction is not required.

\section{WFI in Virtual Operating Modes}

Executing instruction WFI when V=1 causes an illegal instruction
exception, unless it completes within an implementation-specific, bounded time
limit.

\begin{commentary}
The behavior required of WFI in VS-mode and VU-mode is the same as required of
it in U-mode when S-mode exists.

The hypervisor extension augments the trap cause encoding.
Table~\ref{hcauses} lists the possible M-mode and HS-mode trap cause

Codes are added for VS-level interrupts (interrupts 2, 6, 10) and for

\begin{commentary}
HS-mode and VS-mode ECALLs use different cause values so they can be delegated

\subsection{Trap Entry}

When a trap occurs in HS-mode or U-mode, it goes to M-mode, unless
delegated by {\tt medeleg} or {\tt mideleg}, in which case it goes to HS-mode.
When a trap occurs in VS-mode or VU-mode, it goes to M-mode, unless
delegated by {\tt medeleg} or {\tt mideleg}, in which case it goes to HS-mode,
unless further delegated by {\tt hedeleg} or {\tt hideleg}, in which case it
goes to VS-mode.

When a trap is taken into M-mode, virtualization mode V gets set to~0,
and in {\tt mstatus} (or {\tt mstatush}) MPV and MPP are set according to
Table~\ref{h-mpp}.
A trap into M-mode also writes CSRs {\tt mepc}, {\tt mcause},
{\tt mtval}, {\tt mtval2}, and {\tt mtinst}.

to {\tt sstatus}.SPP, and lastly {\tt hstatus}.SPV and {\tt sstatus}.SPP are

\subsection{Transformed Instruction or Pseudoinstruction for {\tt mtinst} or {\tt htinst}}
\label{sec:tinst-vals}

On any trap into M-mode or HS-mode, one of these values is written
automatically into the appropriate trap instruction CSR, {\tt mtinst} or
{\tt htinst}:
\begin{tightlist}
\item
zero;
\item
a transformation of the trapping instruction;
\item
a custom value (allowed only if the trapping instruction is nonstandard);
or
\item
a special pseudoinstruction.
\end{tightlist}
Except when a pseudoinstruction value is required (described later), the
value written to {\tt mtinst} or {\tt htinst} may always be zero,
indicating that the hardware is providing no information in the register
for this particular trap.

\begin{commentary}
The value written to the trap instruction CSR serves two purposes.
The first is to improve the speed of instruction emulation in a trap
handler, partly by allowing the handler to skip loading the trapping
instruction from memory, and partly by obviating some of the work of
decoding and executing the instruction.
The second purpose is to supply, via pseudoinstructions, additional
information about guest-page-fault exceptions caused by implicit memory
accesses done for VS-level address translation.

A \emph{transformation} of the trapping instruction is written instead of
simply a copy of the original instruction in order to minimize the burden
for hardware yet still provide to a trap handler the information needed
to emulate the instruction.
An implementation may at any time reduce its effort by substituting zero
in place of the transformed instruction.
\end{commentary}

On an interrupt, the value written to the trap instruction register is
always zero.
On a synchronous exception, if a nonzero value is written, one of the
following shall be true about the value:

\begin{itemize}

\item
Bit~0 is {\tt 1}, and replacing bit~1 with {\tt 1} makes the value into a
valid encoding of a standard instruction.

In this case, the instruction that trapped is the same kind as indicated
by the register value, and the register value is the transformation of
the trapping instruction, as defined later.
For example, if bits 1:0 are binary {\tt 11} and the register value is
the encoding of a standard LW (load word) instruction, then the trapping
instruction is LW, and the register value is the transformation of the
trapping LW instruction.

\item
Bit~0 is {\tt 1}, and replacing bit~1 with {\tt 1} makes the value into
an instruction encoding that is explicitly available for a custom
instruction (\emph{not} an unused reserved encoding).

This is a \textit{custom value}.
The instruction that trapped is a nonstandard instruction.
The interpretation of a custom value is not otherwise specified by this
standard.

\item
The value is one of the special pseudoinstructions defined later, all of
which have bits 1:0 equal to {\tt 00}.

\end{itemize}

These three cases exclude a large number of other possible values, such
as all those having bits 1:0 equal to binary {\tt 10}.
A future standard or extension may define additional cases, thus allowing
values that are currently excluded.
Software may safely treat an unrecognized value in a trap instruction
register the same as zero.

\begin{commentary}
To be forward-compatible with future revisions of this standard, software
that interprets a nonzero value from {\tt mtinst} or {\tt htinst} must
fully verify that the value conforms to one of the cases listed above.
For instance, for RV64, discovering that bits 6:0 of {\tt mtinst} are
{\tt 0000011} and bits 14:12 are {\tt 010} is not sufficient to establish
that the first case applies and the trapping instruction is a standard LW
instruction;
rather, software must also confirm that bits 63:32 of {\tt mtinst} are
all zeros.
A future standard might define new values for 64-bit {\tt mtinst} that
are nonzero in bits 63:32 yet may coincidentally have in bits 31:0 the
same bit patterns as standard RV64 instructions.
\end{commentary}

\begin{commentary}
Unlike for standard instructions, there is no requirement that the
instruction encoding of a custom value be of the same ``kind'' as the
instruction that trapped (or even have any correlation with the trapping
instruction).
\end{commentary}

Table~\ref{tab:tinst-values} shows the values that may be automatically
written to the trap instruction register for each standard exception
cause.
For exceptions that prevent the fetching of an instruction, only zero or
a pseudoinstruction value may be written.
A custom value may be automatically written only if the instruction that
traps is nonstandard.
A future standard or extension may permit other values to be written,
chosen from the set of allowed values established earlier.

As enumerated in the table, a synchronous exception may write to the trap
instruction register a standard transformation of the trapping
instruction only for exceptions that arise from explicit memory accesses
(from loads, stores, and AMO instructions).
Accordingly, standard transformations are currently defined only for
these memory-access instructions.
If a synchronous trap occurs for a standard instruction for which no
transformation has been defined, the trap instruction register shall be
written with zero (or, under certain circumstances, with a special
pseudoinstruction value).

For a standard load instruction that is not a compressed instruction and
is one of LB, LBU, LH, LHU, LW, LWU, LD, FLW, FLD, or FLQ, the
transformed instruction has the format shown in

In the transformed instructions above, the Addr.\ Offset field that
replaces the instruction's rs1 field in bits 19:15 is the positive
difference between the faulting virtual address (written to {\tt mtval}
or {\tt stval}) and the original virtual address.
This difference can be nonzero only for an access or page fault that
occurs for a misaligned memory access.
Note also that, for basic loads and stores, the transformations replace
the instruction's immediate offset fields with zero.

For a standard compressed instruction (16-bit size), the transformed
instruction is found as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Expand the compressed instruction to its 32-bit equivalent.
\item
Transform the 32-bit equivalent instruction.
\item
Replace bit~1 with a~{\tt 0}.
\end{enumerate}
Bits 1:0 of a transformed standard instruction will be binary {\tt 01} if
the trapping instruction is compressed and {\tt 11} if not.

\begin{commentary}
In decoding the contents of {\tt mtinst} or {\tt htinst}, once software
has determined that the register contains the encoding of a standard
basic load (LB, LBU, LH, LHU, LW, LWU, LD, FLW, FLD, or FLQ) or basic
store (SB, SH, SW, SD, FSW, FSD, or FSQ), it is not necessary to confirm
also that the immediate offset fields (31:25, and 24:20 or 11:7) are
zeros.
The knowledge that the register's value is the encoding of a basic
load/store is sufficient to prove that the trapping instruction is of the
same kind.

A future version of this standard may add information to the fields that
are currently zeros;
however, for backwards compatiblity, any such information will be for
performance purposes only and can safely be ignored.

For guest-page faults, the trap instruction register is written with a
special pseudoinstruction value if:
(a)~the faulting memory access is an implicit access for VS-level address
translation, and
(b)~a nonzero value (the faulting guest physical address) is written to
{\tt mtval2} or {\tt htval}.
If both conditions are met, the value written to {\tt mtinst} or
{\tt htinst} must be taken from Table~\ref{tab:pseudoinsts};
zero is not allowed.

\begin{table*}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Value            & Meaning \\
\hline
{\tt 0x00002000} & 32-bit read for VS-level address translation (RV32) \\
{\tt 0x00002020} & 32-bit write for VS-level address translation (RV32) \\
\hline
{\tt 0x00003000} & 64-bit read for VS-level address translation (RV64) \\
{\tt 0x00003020} & 64-bit write for VS-level address translation (RV64) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\caption{Special pseudoinstruction values for guest-page faults.
The RV32 values are used when VSXLEN=32, and the RV64 values when VSXLEN=64.}

\end{table*}

The defined pseudoinstruction values are designed to correspond closely
with the encodings of basic loads and stores, as illustrated by
Table~\ref{tab:pseudoinsts-basis}.

\begin{table*}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

Encoding         & Instruction \\ \hline
{\tt 0x00002003} & {\tt lw x0,0(x0)} \\
{\tt 0x00002023} & {\tt sw x0,0(x0)} \\ \hline
{\tt 0x00003003} & {\tt ld x0,0(x0)} \\
{\tt 0x00003023} & {\tt sd x0,0(x0)} \\ \hline

psuedoinstructions of Table~\ref{tab:pseudoinsts}.}

A \textit{write} pseudoinstruction ({\tt 0x00002020} or {\tt 0x00003020})
is used for the case that the machine is attempting automatically to
update bits A and/or D in VS-level page tables.
All other implicit memory accesses for VS-level address translation will
be reads.
If a machine never automatically updates bits A or D in VS-level page
tables (leaving this to software), the \textit{write} case will never
arise.
The fact that such a page table update must actually be atomic, not just
a simple write, is ignored for the pseudoinstruction.

\begin{commentary}
If the conditions that necessitate a pseudoinstruction value can ever
occur for M-mode, then {\tt mtinst} cannot be hardwired entirely to zero;
and likewise for HS-mode and {\tt htinst}.
However, in that case, the trap instruction registers may minimally
support only values 0 and {\tt 0x00002000} or {\tt 0x00003000}, and
possibly {\tt 0x00002020} or {\tt 0x00003020}, requiring as few as one or
two flip-flops in hardware, per register.
\end{commentary}

\begin{commentary}
There is no harm here in ignoring the atomicity requirement for page
table updates, because a hypervisor is not expected in these
circumstances to emulate an implicit memory access that fails.
Rather, the hypervisor is given enough information about the faulting
access to be able to make the memory accessible (e.g., by restoring a
missing page of virtual memory) before resuming execution by retrying the
faulting instruction.

\subsection{Trap Return}

The MRET instruction is used to return from a trap taken into M-mode.
MRET first determines what the new operating mode will be according to
the values of MPP and MPV in {\tt mstatus} or {\tt mstatush}, as encoded in
Table~\ref{h-mpp}.
MRET then in {\tt mstatus}/{\tt mstatush} sets MPV=0, MPP=0, MIE=MPIE, and MPIE=1.
If the new operating mode will be U, VS, or VU, MRET also sets
{\tt hstatus}.SPRV=0.
Lastly, MRET sets the virtualization and privilege modes as previously
determined, and sets {\tt pc}={\tt mepc}.

The SRET instruction is used to return from a trap taken into HS-mode or
VS-mode.  Its behavior depends on the current virtualization mode.

When executed in M-mode or HS-mode (i.e., V=0), SRET first determines
what the new operating mode will be according to the values in
{\tt hstatus}.SPV and {\tt sstatus}.SPP, as encoded in Table~\ref{h-spp}.
SRET then sets {\tt hstatus}.SPV={\tt hstatus}.SP2V,
{\tt sstatus}.SPP={\tt hstatus}.SP2P, {\tt hstatus}.SP2V=0,
{\tt hstatus}.SP2P=0, {\tt sstatus}.SIE={\tt sstatus}.SPIE, and
{\tt sstatus}.SPIE=1.
If the new operating mode will be U, VS, or VU, SRET also sets
{\tt hstatus}.SPRV=0.
Lastly, SRET sets the virtualization and privilege modes as previously
determined, and sets {\tt pc}={\tt sepc}.

When executed in VS-mode (i.e., V=1), SRET sets the privilege mode according to
Table~\ref{h-vspp}, then in {\tt vsstatus} sets SPP=0, SIE=SPIE, and SPIE=1, and
lastly sets {\tt pc}={\tt vsepc}.
