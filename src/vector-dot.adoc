== Vector Dot Product Instructions

=== Introduction

This chapter describes the proposed _vector_ _dot_ _product_
extensions for RISC-V.

Convolution operations have seen considerable speedup on other microprocessor architectures with the adoption of specialized dot-product instructions. Such convolutions are used in many AI/ML, image-processing, and DSP algorithms. These algorithms can be found in benchmark suites which are used to measure the relative performance of microprocessor cores with different ISAs against each other. This suite of _vector dot product_ extensions is designed to bring RISC-V vector performance up to or to exceed the level of the competition, depending on the implementation vector-length and number of vector ALUs.

The dot product operation is defined for four INT8 values held in a 32-bit element group with an accumulation back into a single 32-bit value with quad-widening. The dot-product operation takes the 8-bit values at the same index from each source and multiplies them together. The four products are summed together and accumulated into the 32-bit element of the destination register. If the instruction variant has any signed source data then the accumulation is performed into a signed value.

Given that the source data is 8-bits and accumulation is performed into 32-bits, it is presumed that overflow is infrequent and thus no saturation option has been provided. 

To save on opcode encoding space the unsigned-signed vector-vector variant is not encoded; it is always possible to swap the order of the input operands to the signed-unsigned vector-vector variant.

=== Extensions Overview

The section introduces all of the extensions in the Vector Dot Product Instruction Set Extension Specification.

All the Vector Dot Product Extensions can be built on _any_ embedded (Zve*) or application ("V") base Vector Extension.

=== `Zvqdotq` - Vector quad widening 4D Dot Product


8-bit Integer dot-product instructions performing the dot product between two 4-element vectors of 8-bit integer elements and accumulating it into a 32-bit integer accumulator.

`SEW` is used to indicate both the size of the accumulator elements and the size of the 4-element byte vectors.
These instructions are only defined for `SEW`=32.

These vector dot product instructions are defined with a fixed SEW value of 32. They work on an element group with four 8-bit values stored together in a 32-bit bundle. For each input bundle for the dot product there is a corresponding (same index) SEW-wide element in the accumulator source (and destination). The “q” in the mnemonic indicates that the instruction is quad-widening.

The number of body bundles is determined by `vl`. The operation can be masked, each mask bit determines whether the corresponding element result is active or not.

NOTE::
Future variants could be defined for different SEW values thus:

Description::
`vqdot` performs a partial dot product of two vectors of 8-bit signed integers,
accumulating the partial sums into a vector of 32-bit signed integers.
+
In the vector-vector (`.vv`) variant,
each 32-bit element of `vs1` and `vs2` is interpreted as a list of four 8-bit signed integer sub-elements,
whereas each 32-bit element of `vd` is interpreted as a single 32-bit signed integer.
For each pair of elements taken consecutively from `vs1` and `vs2`,
the associated sub-element lists are multiplied componentwise,
widening (with sign-extension) to 32 bits.
Finally, the four products are accumulated into the associated element of `vd`,
wrapping on signed overflow.
+
The vector-scalar (`.vx`) variant reuses a single 32-bit element,
read from integer register `rs1`, instead of a vector (`vs1`) of such elements.
