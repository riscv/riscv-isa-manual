/*
Any ID starting with 'manual__' is a snippet of specification text
that has been specifically tagged to allow referencing it robustly,
for use cases such as:

* Linking coverage, tests plans, tests, assertions etc. to parts of
  the spec that they cover.
* Detecting when parts of the spec change. You can extract these
  snippets via Asciidoc's docbook output and parsing the XML.
* Linking documentation (e.g. the implementation defined parameter list)
  to the spec.

This adds a subtle decoration to make it easier to find tagged text.
