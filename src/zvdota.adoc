== `Zvdota` and `Zvbdota` Families of Dot-Product Extensions, Version 1.0

This document describes several extensions that accelerate the computation
of Euclidean inner products, a.k.a. dot products.
The extensions fall into two classes: dot products between two vectors,
producing a scalar result; and _batched_ dot products, wherein one vector is
broadcast to eight vectors to perform eight dot products, producing a vector of
eight results.
Both classes support a variety of data formats, including widening
accumulations.

NOTE: Some instructions in this proposal use the `vtype`.`altfmt` field,
originally proposed as part of the Zvfbfa extension, to select the format
of one or more of the operands.
This approach helps conserve the limited 32-bit encoding space available
to vector instructions.
Because `altfmt` is written as a consequence of executing the `vsetvli`
instruction needed for stripmine loop control, there is often no performance
overhead to this approach.

=== `Zvdota` Family of Dot-Product Extensions, Version 1.0

Each extension in the `Zvdota` family adds one or more instructions that
compute a dot product between two vector register groups, identified by
`vs2` and `vs1`, producing a scalar result that is accumulated into element
0 of vector register `vd`.

The other elements in `vd` (0 < index < VLEN/SEW) are considered the tail and
are managed with the current tail agnostic/undisturbed policy.

The `vs2` and `vs1` register groups have EMUL=LMUL and EEW=SEW.
The `vd` register always has EMUL=1; its EEW depends on the instruction.

These instructions are maskable.

These instructions always report exceptions with a `vstart` of 0;
executing one with a nonzero `vstart` is reserved.

The destination vector register cannot overlap with the source vector register
groups, otherwise the instruction encoding is reserved.

NOTE: Non-accumulating variants are not provided; `vd[0]` can be initialized
to zero to effect this operation.

==== `Zvqwdota8i` 8-bit Integer Dot-Product Extension, Version 1.0

The Zvqwdota8i extension adds two instructions, each of which computes a dot
product between two 8-bit integer vectors, accumulating into a 32-bit scalar.
The `vqwdotau.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand as unsigned 8-bit
integers, whereas the `vqwdotas.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand
as signed 8-bit integers.
The `vtype`.`altfmt` field selects the signedness of the `vs1` operand,
with 0 indicating unsigned and 1 indicating signed.
These instructions are reserved unless SEW=8.
The `vd` operand has EEW=4*SEW.

----
# Zvqwdota8i 8-bit integer dot-product instructions
# signedness of vs1 supplied by altfmt (0 unsigned, 1 signed)
vqwdotau.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] += unsigned(vs2) dot vs1
vqwdotas.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] += signed(vs2) dot vs1
----

These dot products are computed modulo 2^32^.

The instructions are encoded in major opcode 0x77 with funct3=0,
and with funct6=0x26 for `vqwdotau.vv` and funct6=0x27 for
`vqwdotas.vv`.

The Zvqwdota8i extension depends on the Zve32x extension.

==== `Zvqwdota16i` 16-bit Integer Dot-Product Extension, Version 1.0

The Zvqwdota16i extension adds two instructions, each of which computes a dot
product between two 16-bit integer vectors, accumulating into a 64-bit scalar.
The `vqwdotau.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand as unsigned 16-bit
integers, whereas the `vqwdotas.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand
as signed 16-bit integers.
The `vtype`.`altfmt` field selects the signedness of the `vs1` operand,
with 0 indicating unsigned and 1 indicating signed.
These instructions use the same encodings as those defined in the Zvqwdota8i
extension.
These instructions are reserved unless SEW=16.
The `vd` operand has EEW=4*SEW.

These dot products are computed modulo 2^64^.

The Zvqwdota16i extension depends on the Zve64x extension.

==== `Zvfwdota16bf` BF16 Dot-Product Extension, Version 1.0

The Zvfwdota16bf extension adds one instruction, `vfwdota.vv`, which computes
a dot product between two BF16 vectors, accumulating into an FP32 scalar.
The instruction is reserved unless `vtype`.`altfmt`=1 and SEW=16.
The `vd` operand has EEW=2*SEW.

----
# Zvfwdota16bf BF16 dot-product instruction
# altfmt=1
vfwdota.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] += vs2 dot vs1
----

These dot products are computed using the bulk-normalization scheme defined in
Section <<#DPBulkNorm>>.

The `vfwdota.vv` instruction is encoded in major opcode 0x77 with funct3=1 and funct6=0x24.

NOTE: A future extension could define an instruction that uses the same code
points with `vtype`.`altfmt`=0 to compute IEEE 754 FP16 dot products.

[NOTE]
====
Ordered variants of the floating-point dot-product instructions are not
provided because they can be emulated efficiently using existing instruction
sequences.

An unordered FP32 dot-product instruction is not provided for the same
reason.
====

The Zvfwdota16bf extension depends on the Zve32f extension.

==== `Zvfqwdota8f` OCP FP8 Dot-Product Extension, Version 1.0

The Zvfqwdota8f extension adds two instructions, each of which computes a dot
product between two OCP FP8 vectors, accumulating into an FP32 scalar.
The `vfqwdota.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand as E4M3 numbers,
whereas the `vfqwdota.alt.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand
as E5M2 numbers.
The `vtype`.`altfmt` field selects the datatype of the `vs1` operand,
with 0 indicating E4M3 and 1 indicating E5M2.
These instructions are reserved unless SEW=8.
The `vd` operand has EEW=4*SEW.

----
# Zvfqwdota8f OCP FP8 dot-product instructions
# format of vs1 supplied by altfmt (0 E4M3, 1 E5M2)
vfqwdota.vv     vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] += E4M3(vs2) dot vs1
vfqwdota.alt.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] += E5M2(vs2) dot vs1
----

These dot products are computed using the bulk-normalization scheme defined in
Section <<#DPBulkNorm>>.

The instructions are encoded in major opcode 0x77 with funct3=1,
and with funct6=0x26 for `vfqwdota.vv` and funct6=0x27 for
`vfqwdota.alt.vv`.

The Zvfqwdota8f extension depends on the Zve32f extension.

=== `Zvbdota` Family of Batched Dot-Product Extensions, Version 1.0

Batched dot-product instructions compute up to eight dot products at a time.
Each instruction in these extensions treats `vs1` as an EMUL=1 vector register
group and `vs2` as an EMUL=8 vector register group, computing eight independent
dot products between `vs1` and each of the eight vector registers within `vs2`.
The vector of eight results is accumulated into `vd`, an EMUL=`ceil(8*EEW/VLEN)`
vector register group.

The vector-length register `vl` sets the length of each of the eight dot
products.
Tail elements are substituted with the bit pattern of all zeros, then the
computation is performed as though `vl`=VLMAX.

image::bdota-simple.svg[Static, pdfwidth=4in, title="Zvbdota operation, VLEN &#8804; 8*EEW"]

For long-vector implementations with VLEN > 8*EEW, each instruction also has
a 3-bit scaled-by-8 immediate `ci` indicating which eight elements of `vd`
destination vector are read and written.
The `ci` field is encoded in `vs2[2:0]`; these bits are not needed for the
register address since `vs2` addresses an EMUL=8 register group for these
instructions.
The instruction is reserved if `ci` {ge} `VLEN/(8*EEW)`.

NOTE: The ability to use all of `vd` improves the efficiency of register-tiled
matrix multiplication.

image::bdota-ci.svg[Static, pdfwidth=7in, title="Zvbdota operation, VLEN > 8*EEW"]

Destination elements with index {ge} `ci + 8` are tail elements and are
managed with the current tail agnostic/undisturbed policy.
Destination elements with index < `ci` are prestart elements and are left
undisturbed.
The remaining destination elements are the body elements.

Each instruction is optionally masked by the `v0` mask register.
If masked and the mask bit corresponding to the destination element in `vd` is clear,
the corresponding dot product is not performed, and the destination element is updated
in accordance with the current mask agnostic/undisturbed policy.

The following pseudocode describes the instructions' operation:

```
for n in [0, 7]
  if (unmasked or mask[ci + n])
    for k in [0, vl-1]
      v[vd][ci + n] += v[vs2 + n][k] * v[vs1][k]
```

The destination vector register group cannot overlap with the source vector
register groups, otherwise the instruction encoding is reserved.

These instructions always report exceptions with a `vstart` of 0;
executing one with a nonzero `vstart` is reserved.

[NOTE]
====
Batched dot-product instructions can be thought of as performing 1x``vl``x8
matrix multiplication.
For `C += A*B`, `vs1` holds one row of A, `vs2` holds eight columns of B, and
`vd` holds one row of C.

These instructions have been architected to minimize the amount of code needed
to handle the various matrix-multiplication fringe cases.
The ability to dynamically control `vl` avoids the need to specially handle
the K-dimension fringe cases when K is not a multiple of VLMAX.
Similarly, the `v0` mask handles the N-dimension fringe cases when N is not
a multiple of 8.
The M dimension has no fringe cases, since these instructions only process one
row of the A matrix at a time.

==== `Zvqwbdota8i` 8-bit Integer Batched Dot-Product Extension

The Zvqwbdota8i extension adds instructions that perform batched dot-product
operations on 8-bit integer vectors, accumulating into 32-bit integers.

integers, whereas the `vqwbdotas.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand
as signed 8-bit integers.
The `vtype`.`altfmt` field selects the signedness of the `vs1` operand,
with 0 indicating unsigned and 1 indicating signed.
These instructions are reserved unless SEW=8 and LMUL=1.
The `vs1` and `vs2` operands have EEW=SEW, and the `vd` operand has
EEW=4*SEW.

integers, whereas the `vqwbdotas.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand
as signed 16-bit integers.
The `vtype`.`altfmt` field selects the signedness of the `vs1` operand,
with 0 indicating unsigned and 1 indicating signed.
These instructions use the same encodings as those defined in the Zvqwbdota8i
extension.
These instructions are reserved unless SEW=16 and LMUL=1.
The `vs1` and `vs2` operands have EEW=SEW, and the `vd` operand has
EEW=4*SEW.

==== `Zvfqwbdota8f` OCP FP8 Batched Dot-Product Extension

The Zvfqwbdota8f extension adds instructions that perform batched dot-product
operations on 8-bit OCP FP8 vectors, accumulating into FP32.
The `vfqwbdota.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand as E4M3 numbers,
whereas the `vfqwbdota.alt.vv` instruction treats the `vs2` operand
as E5M2 numbers.
The `vtype`.`altfmt` field selects the datatype of the `vs1` operand,
with 0 indicating E4M3 and 1 indicating E5M2.
These instructions are reserved unless SEW=8 and LMUL=1.
The `vs1` and `vs2` operands have EEW=SEW, and the `vd` operand has

`vfqwbdota.alt.vv`.

The Zvfqwbdota8f extension depends on the Zve32f extension.

==== `Zvfbdota32f` FP32 Batched Dot-Product Extension

The Zvfbdota32f extension adds one instruction, `vfbdota.vv`, which performs
a batched dot-product operation on FP32 vectors, accumulating into FP32.

----
# Zvfbdota32f FP32 batched dot-product instruction
vfbdota.vv vd, vs2, vs1, ci, vm
----

The FP32 products are first computed to full precision, setting the invalid operation
exception flag as appropriate.
The products are then optionally rounded to FP32 according to the dynamic rounding mode,
setting the inexact, overflow, and underflow exception flags as appropriate.
The sum of these products and the accumulator are then computed as though by the
`vfredusum.vs` instruction with SEW=32, including the setting of exception flags.

NOTE: This formulation allows significant implementation flexibility while being sufficiently
precise to implement SGEMM.

NOTE: The algorithm used by the `vfredusum.vs` offers several implementation
choices.
Implementations are not required to use the same algorithm configuration for
the `vfbdota.vv` instruction as for the `vfredusum.vs` instruction.

The `vfbdota.vv` instruction is encoded in major opcode 0x77 with funct3=1 and funct6=0x2b.

==== Sample matrix-multiplication code

Following is an optimized inner loop for 8-bit signed integer matrix
multiplication, accumulating into 32-bit integers, for row-major A and C and
column-major B.
To demonstrate use of the `ci` immediate, we assume VLEN {ge} 512, hence `vd`
can hold at least 16 elements of C.
Each loop iteration processes one 15xVLx16 tile, performing 31 unit-stride loads
of length VL, for 7.7 MACCs per loaded element.
For clarity, the loop is not scheduled.

[#DPBulkNorm]
=== Bulk Normalization of Dot Products

Some of the dot-product instructions allow the intermediate products to be
bulk-normalized to improve efficiency.
This section describes the algorithm and permissible options.

* Substitute any inactive and tail source elements with the bit pattern
of all zeros, and perform the following steps as though `vl`=VLMAX.

* Perform either of the following actions:

** Compute the exact product of each of the VLMAX multiplicand pairs.
** Partition the VLMAX multiplicand pairs into an implementation-defined
number of equal-sized sets; the elements within each set are not necessarily
consecutive.
Process each of these sets using the <<#RVBNA>>, using an output precision
no less than that specified by the instruction.

* Optionally, convert the resulting floating-point numbers to a precision
no less than that specified by the instruction, rounding to odd as described in
<<#RVBNARTO>>.

* Sum the resulting floating-point numbers and the accumulator input
in a manner consistent with the algorithm used by the `vfredusum.vs`
instruction, rounding to odd as described in <<#RVBNARTO>>, in a precision no
less than the output precision specified by the instruction.

* Convert the scalar result to the instruction's output precision,
rounding to odd as described in <<#RVBNARTO>>.

NOTE: The algorithm used by the `vfredusum.vs` offers several implementation
choices.
Implementations are not required to use the same algorithm configuration for
batched dot products as for the `vfredusum.vs` instruction.

[#RVBNA]
=== RISC-V Bulk Normalization Algorithm

This section defines the RISC-V Bulk Normalization Algorithm (RVBNA), a scheme
employed by multiple RISC-V extensions for efficient computation of
floating-point dot products.

A correctly rounded dot product is costly, and many applications do not
require such a degree of accuracy.
RVBNA reduces circuit cost and delay in exchange for a slight reduction in
accuracy using _bulk normalization_, wherein all products are aligned with
respect to a common exponent, called the _maximum reference exponent_, or
`max_exp`.
Aligned products are rounded to an intermediate precision according to round-to-odd (RTO), then summed.
The sum is then rounded to the target precision according to RTO, but unlike
RTO, out-of-range values are rounded to infinity, instead of the largest
representable number.

Formally, bulk normalization is characterized by multiple parameters:

- `p`: the size of each factor's significand (significand product is `2p`-bit wide, signed product is `2p+1`-bit wide)
- `e`: the size of each factor's biased exponent (the bias is `2^(e-1) - 1`)
- `q`: the size of the result's significand
- `f`: the size of the result's biased exponent (the bias is `2^(f-1) - 1`)
- `n`: the number of products accumulated
- `o`: the number of overflow bits
- `g`: the number of guard bits

`o` is defined to accommodate any carry overflow and is defined to be `ceil(log2(n))`.

The number of guard bits, `g`, is defined to be `ceil(log2(n))`.

Note:: It is expected that `n` would be a constant defined by each operation/implementation using RVBNA.
`n` is not expected to depend on a dynamic parameter such as `vl`. Dot product operations are still allowed to use `vl` or any dynamic length parameter but are encouraged to not link this to the bulk normalization parameters (which is similar to assuming identity-value products are injected in place of inactive elements).
`n` may vary depending on the element width (e.g. be different for different values of `SEW`).

Note:: Given the recommendation made on `n`, RVBNA mandates a fixed value of `g` for a given format size.
This reduces the space of possible implementations. An implementation using RVBNA for different formats with different `n` values requires support for multiple values of `g`.
Supporting multiple values of `g` is straightforward: an implementation can build a shared accumulator datapath based on the maximum `g` value: gmax.
Behavior for smaller `g` values would be obtained by OR-reducing both the sticky bits defined by `gmax` and the extra `gmax - g` least significant bits of the aligned products into the least significant accumulator bit. This should not require more than a few extra gates for hardware implementations.

Note:: In its current version, RVBNA is only defined for symmetric products (i.e., both factors have the same `e` and `p`). It could be later extended to asymmetric products (mixed formats) if the need arises.

Informally, RVBNA works as follows:

- Computing maximum exponent `max_exp`:
**** Computing each product and the addend **reference exponent** (details in <<#RVBNAReferenceExponent>>)
**** Computing `max_exp`, the maximum of the **reference exponents**
- Aligning product magnitudes on `max_exp` (2 integer bits and `2*p-2` fractional bits)
**** Each product is extended to `q-1+g` fractional bits (right padding of `(q-1+g) - (2*p-2)` zeros)
**** Each extended product is right shifted by its reference exponent subtracted from `max_exp` (discarded significand bits are OR-reduced with any trailing bits when performing RTO)
- Rounding to odd each aligned product magnitude
- Selecting an accumulator sign `S`, negating the aligned-rounded product(s) whose sign does not match `S`
- Accumulating the rounded products. If the final sum is negative, negate it and negate `S` as well
- Normalizing/Denormalizing the result and round it to odd to binary32 mantissa `M`, computing the result exponent, `E`
- Building output result from `S`, `E`, and `M`

Bulk Normalization is illustrated by Figure <<#RVBNAFig>>. 4 products are aligned.
For the two bottom products, some bits fall under the guard bit limits. For each product those bits are OR-ed into the least significant guard bit.

Note:: In the current specification the most significant bit of the max product has a weight of `max_exp + 1`, which means that there are `q-2+g` fractional bits in the max product. `g` could be increased to `ceil(log2(n)) + 1` to ensure the number of fractional bits is at least `q-1` (identical to the output format). Numerical impacts of the value of `g` have not been evaluated.

Note:: Any one of the `2*p` bits of the max product can be the leading bit due to leading zeros in subnormal inputs. It is also possible for the maximum product to have more leading zeros than the other products (including when product alignment is taken into account). This is discussed in more detailed in the next section <<#RVBNAReferenceExponent>>.

Note:: The RVBNA pseudocode assumes that operands are IEEE encoded, but this is not actually a requirement of RVBNA.
The pseudocode can easily be generalized to other floating-point encodings (e.g. Open Compute OFP formats).
The actual requirement is to used biased exponent to compute the reference exponent and not real exponent (in particular because we want to avoid normalizing subnormal operands before computing the reference exponent).
The significand also need to be materialized correctly for the product (including possible implicit digit(s)).

[#RVBNAReferenceExponent]
==== Reference Exponent

The **reference exponent** is a proxy to the product exponent used to determine the largest product and to align the smaller products with respect to it.


The **reference exponent** of a product is evaluated as the sum of the factors' biased exponents.
If a non-zero factor is subnormal then biased `emin_normal` (`=1`) is used as its biased exponent, for purposes of computing the **reference exponent**.

Note:: the minimal reference exponent for a non-zero product is `2` (`emin_normal + emin_normal`).

If a product operand is zero then the product exponent is set to a value which ensures that every non-zero product is considered greater than every zero product when determining the maximum product. A zero product should not force any loss of accuracy on non-zero products.

Note:: for a dot product where the left hand side vector and the right hand side vector have different formats then the bias used for the exponent may differ.
This bias has no impact on the difference between the **reference exponents**.

Note:: The **reference exponent** may differ from the product exponent (with the latter being defined as the exponent of the leading non-zero digit of the product). For example it does not take into account the actual number of leading zeros of the product (which can be large if at least one of the operand is subnormal). This simplification implies that the `max_exp` used to align products may not actually be that close to the real exponent of the maximum product and the maximum product could even be different from the one that set `max_exp`. Using the reference exponent rather the real exponent simplifies the product exponent evaluation and comparison logic.





==== Rounding modes

For floating-point dot product operations, RVBNA only supports rounding-to-odd (RTO) with some specificites (see <<#RVBNARTO>>).

For floating-point multiply operations, RVBNA supports all the rounding modes mandated by RISC-V **F** extension.

For integer operations, no rounding is required.

[#RVBNARTO]
==== Rounding to Odd behavior in dot product mode

Rounding to odd (RTO) is not part of the IEEE-754 standard (at least not until and including revision 2019).

The version used for the dot product operation admits two divergences with the generally accepted definition:

- When overflowing, an infinity result is returned (rather than the largest magnitude normal number) see <<#RVBNAOverflow>>
- A zero result is always positive (+0) whatever the sign of the actual zero term(s) of the dot product sum


==== Support for subnormal numbers

RVBNA supports subnormal values for both inputs and outputs:

- the subnormal inputs are not normalized before or after the product
- the biased subnormal input exponent is fixed to `emin_normal` for each subnormal operand when computing the product reference exponent (used to evaluate `max_exp` and shift amounts)
- the result is denormalized before the final round-to-odd is applied.

==== Behavior on floating-point zeros

If the result of a dot product operation is zero, then `+0` is returned, even if `-0` would have been returned under IEEE 754 arithmetic.

==== IEEE flags

Under RVBNA, only the invalid operation and overflow exceptions can be raised.

===== Invalid operation

The invalid operation flag must be raised if at least one of the following conditions is met:

- Any of the operands is a signaling NaN
- At least one of the following conditions:
**** there are at least two products that are infinites with opposite sign.
**** there is at least one product between a zero and an infinity.

// comment to force next notes to be left aligned
Note:: A product is said to be infinite when it is the product between an infinity and a non-zero finite number.

Note:: The invalid exception flag can be raised even if one of the operands is a quiet NaN (for example with `inf - inf + qNaN`, or `inf * 0 + qNaN`)


[#RVBNAOverflow]
===== Overflow

The overflow flag is raised according to the IEEE-754 definition:

> The overflow exception shall be signaled if and only if the destination format’s largest finite number is exceeded in magnitude by what would have been the rounded floating-point result were the exponent range unbounded.

The result returned in case of an overflow is infinity with the sign of the result with unbounded exponent. This diverges from a generally accepted definition of RTO (which rounds values exceeding the largest finite value to that extremum).

Note:: In rounding-to-odd (RTO), it is equivalent to detect overflow before or after rounding as RTO rounding cannot make the significand overflow and force a late exponent change. This applies whatever the choice for the result returned in case of overflow.
