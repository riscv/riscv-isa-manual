== "Zish4add" Extension for 16-byte pointer addition, Version 0.9

The B-extension adds `SH[1|2|3]ADD` instructions, and for RV64 all have
an unsigned word .UW version.

Zish4add adds two new analogous instructions to RV64: SH4ADD and SH4ADD.UW.

    { bits:  5, name: 'rs2' },
    { bits:  7, name: 16, attr: ['rv64: SH4ADD'] },

Increment `rs2` by `rs1` shifted left by 4 bit positions and write the result to `rd`.
