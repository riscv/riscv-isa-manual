== "Smcdeleg" Counter Delegation Extension, Version 1.0

In modern “Rich OS” environments, hardware performance monitoring
resources are managed by the kernel, kernel driver, and/or hypervisor.
Counters may be configured with differing scopes, in some cases counting
events system-wide, while in others counting events on behalf of a
single virtual machine or application. In such environments, the latency
of counter writes has a direct impact on overall profiling overhead as a
result of frequent counter writes during:

. Sample collection, to clear overflow indication, and reload overflowed
counter(s)
. Context switch, between processes, threads, containers, or virtual
machines

This extension provides a means for M-mode to allow writing select
counters and event selectors from S/HS-mode. The purpose is to avert
transitions to and from M-mode that add latency to these performance
critical supervisor/hypervisor code sections. This extension also
defines one new CSR, scountinhibit.

For a Machine-level environment, extension *Smcdeleg* (‘Sm’ for
Privileged architecture and Machine-level extension, ‘cdeleg’ for
Counter Delegation) encompasses all added CSRs and all behavior
modifications for a hart, over all privilege levels. For a
Supervisor-level environment, extension *Ssccfg* (‘Ss’ for Privileged
architecture and Supervisor-level extension, ‘ccfg’ for Counter
Configuration) provides access to delegated counters, and to new
supervisor-level state.

=== Counter Delegation

The `mcounteren` register allows M-mode to provide the next-lower
privilege mode with read access to select counters. When the Smcdeleg/Ssccfg
extension is enabled (`menvcfg`.CDE=1), it further allows M-mode to delegate select
counters to S-mode.

The `siselect` (and `vsiselect`) index range 0x40-0x5F is reserved for
delegated counter access. When a counter _i_ is delegated
(`mcounteren`[_i_]=1 and `menvcfg`.CDE=1), the register state associated
with counter _i_ can be read or written via `sireg*`, while `siselect` holds
0x40+__i__. The counter state accessible via alias CSRs is shown in
the table below.

[NOTE]
====
`__hpmevent__i` _represents a subset of the state accessed by the_ `__mhpmevent__i` _register. Likewise, `cyclecfg` and `instretcfg` represent a subset of the state accessed by the `mcyclecfg` and `minstretcfg` registers, respectively. See below for subset details._
====

If extension Smstateen is implemented, refer to extension Smcsrind/Sscsrind (<<indirect-csr>>) for how setting bit 60 of CSR
`mstateen0` to zero prevents access to registers `siselect`, `sireg*`,
`vsiselect`, and `vsireg*` from privileged modes less privileged than
M-mode, and likewise how setting bit 60 of `hstateen0` to zero prevents
access to `siselect` and `sireg*` (really `vsiselect` and `vsireg*`) from
VS-mode.

The remaining rules of this section apply only when access to a CSR is
not blocked by `mstateen0`[60] = 0 or `hstateen0`[60] = 0.

While the privilege mode is M or S and `siselect` holds a value in the
range 0x40-0x5F, illegal instruction exceptions are raised for the
following cases:

* attempts to access any `sireg*` when `menvcfg`.CDE = 0;
* attempts to access `sireg3` or `sireg6`;
* attempts to access `sireg4` or `sireg5` when XLEN = 64;
* attempts to access `sireg*` when `siselect` = 0x41, or when the counter
selected by `siselect` is not delegated to S-mode (the corresponding bit
in `mcounteren` = 0).

NOTE: _The memory-mapped `mtime` register is not a performance monitoring
counter to be managed by supervisor software, hence the special
treatment of `siselect` value 0x41 described above._

For each `siselect` and `sireg*` combination defined in <<indirect-hpm-state-mappings>>, the table
further indicates the extensions upon which the underlying counter state
depends. If any extension upon which the underlying state depends is not
implemented, an attempt from M or S mode to access the given state
through `sireg*` raises an illegal instruction exception.

If the hypervisor (H) extension is also implemented, then as specified
by extension Smcsrind/Sscsrind, a virtual instruction exception is
raised for attempts from VS-mode or VU-mode to directly access `vsiselect`
or `vsireg*`, or attempts from VU-mode to access `siselect` or `sireg*`. Furthermore, while `vsiselect` holds a value in the range 0x40-0x5F:

* An attempt to access any `vsireg*` from M or S mode raises an illegal
instruction exception.
* An attempt from VS-mode to access any `sireg*` (really `vsireg*`) raises an illegal instruction exception if `menvcfg`.CDE = 0, or a virtual
instruction exception if `menvcfg`.CDE = 1.

If Sscofpmf is implemented, `sireg2` and `sireg5` provide access only to a
subset of the event selector registers. Specifically, event selector bit
62 (MINH) is read-only 0 when accessed through `sireg*`. Similarly, if
Smcntrpmf is implemented, `sireg2` and `sireg5` provide access only to a
subset of the counter configuration registers. Counter configuration
register bit 62 (MINH) is read-only 0 when accessed through `sireg*`.

=== Supervisor Counter Inhibit (`scountinhibit`) Register

Smcdeleg/Ssccfg defines a new `scountinhibit` register, a masked alias of
`mcountinhibit`. For counters delegated to S-mode, the associated
`mcountinhibit` bits can be accessed via `scountinhibit`. For counters not
delegated to S-mode, the associated bits in `scountinhibit` are read-only
zero.

When `menvcfg`.CDE=0, attempts to access `scountinhibit` raise an illegal
instruction exception. When the Supervisor Counter Delegation extension
is enabled, attempts to access `scountinhibit` from VS-mode or VU-mode
raise a virtual instruction exception.

=== Virtualizing `scountovf`

For implementations that support Smcdeleg/Ssccfg, Sscofpmf, and the H
extension, when `menvcfg`.CDE=1, attempts to access `scountovf` from VS-mode
or VU-mode raise a virtual instruction exception.

=== Virtualizing Local Counter Overflow Interrupts 

For implementations that support Smcdeleg, Sscofpmf, and Smaia, the
local counter overflow interrupt (LCOFI) bit (bit 13) in each of CSRs
`mvip` and `mvien` is implemented and writable.

For implementations that support Smcdeleg/Ssccfg, Sscofpmf,
Smaia/Ssaia, and the H extension, the LCOFI bit (bit 13) in each of `hvip`
and `hvien` is implemented and writable.

[NOTE]
====
_The `hvip` register is defined by the hypervisor (H) extension, while the `mvien` and `hvien` registers are defined by the Smaia/Ssaia extension._

_By virtue of implementing `hvip`.LCOFI, it is implicit that the LCOFI bit (bit 13) in each of `vsie` and `vsip` is also implemented._

_Requiring support for the LCOFI bits listed above ensures that virtual LCOFIs can be delivered to an OS running in S-mode, and to a guest OS running in VS-mode. It is optional whether the LCOFI bit (bit 13) in each of `mideleg` and `hideleg`, which allows all LCOFIs to be delegated to S-mode and VS-mode, respectively, is implemented and writable._
