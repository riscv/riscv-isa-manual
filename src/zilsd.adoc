== "Zilsd", "Zclsd" Extensions for Load/Store pair for RV32, Version 1.0

The Zilsd & Zclsd extensions provide load/store pair instructions for RV32, reusing the existing RV64 doubleword load/store instruction encodings.

Operands containing `src` for store instructions and `dest` for load instructions are held in aligned `x`-register pairs, i.e., register numbers must be even. Use of misaligned (odd-numbered) registers for these operands is _reserved_.

Regardless of endianness, the lower-numbered register holds the
low-order bits, and the higher-numbered register holds the high-order
bits: e.g., bits 31:0 of an operand in Zilsd might be held in register `x14`, with bits 63:32 of that operand held in `x15`.

=== Load/Store pair instructions (Zilsd)

The Zilsd extension adds the following RV32-only instructions:

[%header,cols="^1,^1,4,8"]
|===
|RV32
|RV64
|Mnemonic
|Instruction

|yes
|no
|ld rd, offset(rs1)
|<<#insns-ld>>

|yes
|no
|sd rs2, offset(rs1)
|<<#insns-sd>>

|===

As the access size is 64-bit, accesses are only considered naturally aligned for effective addresses that are a multiple of 8.
In this case, these instructions are guaranteed to not raise an address-misaligned exception.
Even if naturally aligned, the memory access might not be performed atomically.

If the effective address is a multiple of 4, then each word access is required to be performed atomically.

The following table summarizes the required behavior:

[%header]
|===
|Alignment |Word accesses guaranteed atomic? |Can cause misaligned trap?
|8B |yes |no
|4B not 8B |yes |yes
|else |no | yes
|===

To ensure resumable trap handling is possible for the load instructions, the base register must have its original value if a trap is taken. The other register in the pair can have been updated.
This affects x2 for the stack pointer relative instruction and rs1 otherwise.

[NOTE]
====
If an implementation performs a doubleword load access atomically and the register file implements writeback for even/odd register pairs,
the mentioned atomicity requirements are inherently fulfilled.
Otherwise, an implementation either needs to delay the writeback until the write can be performed atomically,
or order sequential writes to the registers to ensure the requirement above is satisfied.

=== Compressed Load/Store pair instructions (Zclsd)

Zclsd depends on Zilsd and Zca. It has overlapping encodings with Zcf and is thus incompatible with Zcf.

Zclsd adds the following RV32-only instructions:

[%header,cols="^1,^1,4,8"]
|===
|RV32
|RV64
|Mnemonic
|Instruction

|yes
|no
|c.ldsp rd, offset(sp)
|<<#insns-cldsp>>

|yes
|no
|c.sdsp rs2, offset(sp)
|<<#insns-csdsp>>

|yes
|no
|c.ld rd', offset(rs1')
|<<#insns-cld>>

|yes
|no
|c.sd rs2', offset(rs1')
|<<#insns-csd>>

|===

=== Use of x0 as operand

LD instructions with destination `x0` are processed as any other load, but the result is discarded entirely and x1 is not written.
For C.LDSP, usage of `x0` as the destination is reserved.

If using `x0` as `src` of SD or C.SDSP, the entire 64-bit operand is zero — i.e., register `x1` is not accessed.

C.LD and C.SD instructions can only use `x8-15`.

=== Exception Handling

For the purposes of RVWMO and exception handling, LD and SD instructions are
considered to be misaligned loads and stores, with one additional constraint:
an LD or SD instruction whose effective address is a multiple of 4 gives rise
to two 4-byte memory operations.

NOTE: This definition permits LD and SD instructions giving rise to exactly one
memory access, regardless of alignment.
If instructions with 4-byte-aligned effective address are decomposed
into two 32b operations, there is no constraint on the order in which the
operations are performed and each operation is guaranteed to be atomic.
These decomposed sequences are interruptible.
Exceptions might occur on subsequent operations, making the effects of previous
operations within the same instruction visible.

NOTE: Software should make no assumptions about the number or order of
accesses these instructions might give rise to, beyond the 4-byte constraint
mentioned above.
For example, an interrupted store might overwrite the same bytes upon return
from the interrupt handler.
