== "Smpmpind" Extension for Indirect PMP CSR Access, Version 0.1

The Smpmpind extension defines a range of selector values for accessing PMP
registers using the CSRs provided by the Smcsrind extension. The Smpmpind
extension depends on the Smcsrind extension.

For indirect access to PMP registers, `miselect` selects the target PMP
entry; `mireg` accesses its `pmpaddr` register, and `mireg2` accesses its
`pmpcfg` register. The `mireg3` through `mireg6` CSRs are reserved.

The `pmpcfg` is a MXLEN wide register. The low 8 bits of this register are an
alias of the 8-bit field of the PMP configuration register for this entry
that can be accessed using a direct CSR access.

The behavior of PMP entry locking is unchanged by this extension.

Bit MXLEN-1 of the `pmpcfg` register is defined as the extended-attributes (`E`)
field. When the `E` field is 0, the `XWR` bits in the `pmpcfg` register are
interpreted as if the `Smpmpind` extension were not implemented.

When the `E` field is 1, all encodings of the `XWR` bits are reserved unless
they are defined by another standard extension. Attempting to access a PMP
region when `E` is 1 and the `XWR` encoding is reserved raises an access fault
exception corresponding to the original access type.

== "Smcfiss" Extension for Machine-mode Shadow Stack, Version 0.1

The Smcfiss extension enables the use of a shadow stack to enforce
backward-edge control-flow integrity in machine mode.

The Smcfiss extension depends on the Zicfiss and Smpmpind extensions.

The Smcfiss extension introduces an `MSSE` field in `mseccfg` to enable the use
of Zicfiss in machine mode. When the Smcfiss extension is implemented, the
shadow-stack-enabled (SSE) state, denoted by the term `xSSE`, is set to the
value of `mseccfg.MSSE`. When Smcfiss is not implemented, the `MSSE` field is
read-only zero.

When the Smepmp extension is also implemented, if the `mseccfg.RLB` field is 0
while `pmpcfg.L` is 1 in any PMP entry, further writes to the `mseccfg.MSSE`
field are ignored until a PMP reset.

When `mseccfg.MSSE` is 1, a PMP entry with `E=1` and `XWR=010` denotes an M-mode
shadow stack memory region.

When `E=1` and `mseccfg.MSSE` is 0, the `XWR=010` encoding remains reserved.

The following rules apply to accesses to M-mode shadow stack memory regions:

* When the effective privilege mode of an access is M:
  ** Shadow stack instructions are permitted to access only M-mode shadow stack
     memory regions. Any attempt by a shadow stack instruction to access a
     memory region that is not an M-mode shadow stack memory region raises a
     store/AMO access fault exception.
  ** Instructions other than shadow stack instructions are not permitted to
     store to an M-mode shadow stack memory region. Any such attempt raises a
     store/AMO access fault exception.
  ** The M-mode shadow stack memory region may be read either by explicit load
     instructions or by shadow stack instructions.
  ** Implicit accesses, including instruction fetches, to an M-mode shadow stack
     memory region raise an access fault exception corresponding to the original
     access type.

* When the effective privilege mode of an access is less than M, any access
  to an M-mode shadow stack memory region raises an access fault exception
  corresponding to the original access type.

== "Smucfiss" Extension for User-mode Shadow Stack for M+U, Version 0.1

The Smucfiss extension enables the use of a shadow stack to enforce
backward-edge control-flow integrity in user mode using PMPs when the S-mode
is not implemented.

The Smucfiss extension depends on the Zicfiss and Smcfiss extensions. The
Smucfiss extension is not supported when the S-mode is implemented.

When Smucfiss is implemented, the following rules apply:

* The shadow-stack-enabled (SSE) state, denoted by the term `xSSE`, is set to
  the value of `menvcfg.SSE` for U-mode, enabling the use of Zicfiss in U-mode.
* When `menvcfg.SSE` is 1, a PMP entry configured with `E=1` and `XWR=110`
  denotes a U-mode shadow stack memory region.
* When `E=1` and `menvcfg.SSE` is 0, the `XWR=110` encoding remains reserved.

The following rules apply to accesses to U-mode shadow stack memory regions:

* When the effective privilege mode of an access is U:
  ** Shadow stack instructions are permitted to access only U-mode shadow stack
     memory regions. Any attempt by a shadow stack instruction to access a
     memory region that is not a U-mode shadow stack memory region raises a
     store/AMO access fault exception.
  ** Instructions other than shadow stack instructions are not permitted to
     store to a U-mode shadow stack memory region. Any such attempt raises a
     store/AMO access fault exception.
  ** The U-mode shadow stack memory region may be read either by explicit load
     instructions or by shadow stack instructions.
  ** Implicit accesses, including instruction fetches, to a U-mode shadow stack
     memory region raise an access fault exception corresponding to the original
     access type.

* When the effective privilege mode of an access is not U, any access
  to a U-mode shadow stack memory region raises an access fault exception
  corresponding to the original access type.

== "Sspmpss" Extension for S-level PMP Shadow Stack, Version 0.1

The Sspmpss extension enables the use of a shadow stack to enforce
backward-edge control-flow integrity for S/HS- and U-mode software using
S-level PMP (SPMP). The Sspmpss extension depends on the Zicfiss and
Sspmp extensions.

If `satp.MODE` is not `Bare` or if `menvcfg.SSE` is 0, the implementation
behaves as if Sspmpss is not implemented. When Sspmpss is implemented, the
`XWR=010` encoding in `spmpcfg[i]` with `spmpcfg.SHARED=0` denotes a shadow
stack memory region. When Sspmpss is not implemented, the `XWR=010` encoding
with `spmpcfg.SHARED=0` remains reserved.

When Sspmpss is implemented, the following additional rules apply to memory
accesses with effective privilege mode S or U, and also HS when the H extension
is also implemented.

* Shadow stack instructions are permitted to access only shadow stack memory
  regions. Any attempt by a shadow stack instruction to access a memory region
  that is not a shadow stack memory region raises a store/AMO access fault
  exception.
* Instructions other than shadow stack instructions are not permitted to store
  to a shadow stack memory region. Any such attempt raises a store/AMO
  access fault exception.
* Implicit accesses, including instruction fetches, to a shadow stack memory
  region raise an access fault exception corresponding to the original access
  type.
* Shadow stack memory regions may be read either by explicit load instructions
  or by shadow stack instructions.

The access faults caused by these additional rules occur at lower priority than
a page fault due to the memory access being disallowed by the U bit, given the
effective privilege mode of the access and the state of the `SUM` and `MXR`
fields of the `mstatus` register.

When the H extension is also implemented, the following additional rules apply
to memory accesses with effective privilege mode VS or VU:

* Shadow stack instructions that access memory require the SPMP to grant both
  read and write permissions; otherwise, a store/AMO guest-page fault exception
  is raised.
* Attempts to access a memory region configured with `XWR=010` in the matching
  SPMP entry--including by shadow stack instructions or implicit accesses--raise
  a guest-page fault exception corresponding to the original access type.
