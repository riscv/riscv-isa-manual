    { bits:  7, name: 0x3b, attr: ['OP-32'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },

Description::
This instruction performs an XLEN-wide addition of two addends.
The first addend is _rs2_.
The second addend is the unsigned value formed by extracting the least-significant word of _rs1_ and shifting it left by 2 places.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
let base = X(rs2);
let index = EXTZ(X(rs1)[31..0]);

X(rd) = base + (index << 2);
