{reg:[
    { bits:  7, name: 0x3b, attr: ['OP-32'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x2, attr: ['SH1ADD.UW'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs1' },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs2' },
    { bits:  7, name: 0x10, attr: ['SH1ADD.UW']  },
]}

Description::
This instruction performs an XLEN-wide addition of two addends.
The first addend is _rs2_. The second addend is the unsigned value formed by extracting the least-significant word of _rs1_ and shifting it left by 1 place.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
let base = X(rs2);
let index = EXTZ(X(rs1)[31..0]);

X(rd) = base + (index << 1);
--
