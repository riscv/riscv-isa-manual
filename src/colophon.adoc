|===

The changes in this version of the document include:

* Moved description to *Ratified* for the ISA modules ratified by the
board in early 2019.
* Removed the A extension from ratification.
* Changed document version scheme to avoid confusion with versions of
the ISA modules.
* Incremented the version numbers of the base integer ISA to 2.1,
reflecting the presence of the ratified RVWMO memory model and exclusion
of FENCE.I, counters, and CSR instructions that were in previous base
ISA.
* Incremented the version numbers of the F and D extensions to 2.2,
reflecting that version 2.1 changed the canonical NaN, and version 2.2
defined the NaN-boxing scheme and changed the definition of the FMIN and
FMAX instructions.
* Changed name of document to refer to "unprivileged" instructions as
part of move to separate ISA specifications from platform profile
mandates.
* Added clearer and more precise definitions of execution environments,
harts, traps, and memory accesses.
* Defined instruction-set categories: _standard_, _reserved_, _custom_,
_non-standard_, and _non-conforming_.
* Removed text implying operation under alternate endianness, as
alternate-endianness operation has not yet been defined for RISC-V.
* Changed description of misaligned load and store behavior. The
specification now allows visible misaligned address traps in execution
environment interfaces, rather than just mandating invisible handling of
misaligned loads and stores in user mode. Also, now allows access-fault
exceptions to be reported for misaligned accesses (including atomics)
that should not be emulated.
* Moved FENCE.I out of the mandatory base and into a separate extension,
with Zifencei ISA name. FENCE.I was removed from the Linux user ABI and
is problematic in implementations with large incoherent instruction and
data caches. However, it remains the only standard instruction-fetch
coherence mechanism.
* Removed prohibitions on using RV32E with other extensions.
* Removed platform-specific mandates that certain encodings produce
illegal-instruction exceptions in RV32E and RV64I chapters.
* Counter/timer instructions are now not considered part of the
mandatory base ISA, and so CSR instructions were moved into separate
chapter and marked as version 2.0, with the unprivileged counters moved
into another separate chapter. The counters are not ready for
ratification as there are outstanding issues, including counter
inaccuracies.
* A CSR-access ordering model has been added.
* Explicitly defined the 16-bit half-precision floating-point format for
floating-point instructions in the 2-bit _fmt field._
* Defined the signed-zero behavior of FMIN._fmt_ and FMAX._fmt_, and
changed their behavior on signaling-NaN inputs to conform to the
minimumNumber and maximumNumber operations in the proposed IEEE 754-201x
specification.
* The memory consistency model, RVWMO, has been defined.
* The "Zam" extension, which permits misaligned AMOs and specifies
their semantics, has been defined.
* The "Ztso" extension, which enforces a stricter memory consistency
model than RVWMO, has been defined.
* Improvements to the description and commentary.
* Defined the term `IALIGN` as shorthand to describe the
instruction-address alignment constraint.
* Removed text of `P` extension chapter as now superseded by active task
group documents.
* Removed text of `V` extension chapter as now superseded by separate
vector extension draft document.

To date, no parts of the standard have been officially ratified by the
RISC-V Foundation, but the components labeled "frozen" above are not
expected to change during the ratification process beyond resolving
ambiguities and holes in the specification.

The major changes in this version of the document include:

* The previous version of this document was released under a Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International License by the original authors,
and this and future versions of this document will be released under the
same license.
* Rearranged chapters to put all extensions first in canonical order.
* Improvements to the description and commentary.
* Modified implicit hinting suggestion on `JALR` to support more efficient
macro-op fusion of `LUI/JALR` and `AUIPC/JALR` pairs.
* Clarification of constraints on load-reserved/store-conditional
sequences.
* A new table of control and status register (CSR) mappings.
* Clarified purpose and behavior of high-order bits of `fcsr`.
* Corrected the description of the `FNMADD`._fmt_ and `FNMSUB`._fmt_
instructions, which had suggested the incorrect sign of a zero result.
* Instructions `FMV.S.X` and `FMV.X.S` were renamed to `FMV.W.X` and `FMV.X.W`
respectively to be more consistent with their semantics, which did not
change. The old names will continue to be supported in the tools.
* Specified behavior of narrower (latexmath:[$<$]FLEN) floating-point
values held in wider `f` registers using NaN-boxing model.
* Defined the exception behavior of FMA(latexmath:[$\infty$], 0, qNaN).
* Added note indicating that the `P` extension might be reworked into an
integer packed-SIMD proposal for fixed-point operations using the
integer registers.
* A draft proposal of the V vector instruction-set extension.
* An early draft proposal of the N user-level traps extension.
* An expanded pseudoinstruction listing.
* Removal of the calling convention chapter, which has been superseded
by the RISC-V ELF psABI Specification cite:[riscv-elf-psabi].
* The C extension has been frozen and renumbered version 2.0.

[.big]*_Preface to Document Version 2.1_*

This is version 2.1 of the document describing the RISC-V user-level
architecture. Note the frozen user-level ISA base and extensions `IMAFDQ`
version 2.0 have not changed from the previous version of this
document cite:[riscvtr2], but some specification holes have been fixed and the
documentation has been improved. Some changes have been made to the
software conventions.

* Numerous additions and improvements to the commentary sections.
* Separate version numbers for each chapter.
* Modification to long instruction encodings latexmath:[$>$]64 bits to
avoid moving the _rd_ specifier in very long instruction formats.
* CSR instructions are now described in the base integer format where
the counter registers are introduced, as opposed to only being
introduced later in the floating-point section (and the companion
privileged architecture manual).
* The SCALL and SBREAK instructions have been renamed to `ECALL` and
`EBREAK`, respectively. Their encoding and functionality are unchanged.
* Clarification of floating-point NaN handling, and a new canonical NaN
value.
* Clarification of values returned by floating-point to integer
conversions that overflow.
* Clarification of `LR/SC` allowed successes and required failures,
including use of compressed instructions in the sequence.
* A new `RV32E` base ISA proposal for reduced integer register counts,
supports `MAC` extensions.
* A revised calling convention.
* Relaxed stack alignment for soft-float calling convention, and
description of the RV32E calling convention.
* A revised proposal for the `C` compressed extension, version 1.9 .

[.big]*_Preface to Version 2.0_*

This is the second release of the user ISA specification, and we intend
the specification of the base user ISA plus general extensions (i.e.,
IMAFD) to remain fixed for future development. The following changes
have been made since Version 1.0 cite:[riscvtr] of this ISA specification.

* The ISA has been divided into an integer base with several standard
extensions.
* The instruction formats have been rearranged to make immediate
encoding more efficient.
* The base ISA has been defined to have a little-endian memory system,
with big-endian or bi-endian as non-standard variants.
* Load-Reserved/Store-Conditional (`LR/SC`) instructions have been added
in the atomic instruction extension.
* `AMOs` and `LR/SC` can support the release consistency model.
* The `FENCE` instruction provides finer-grain memory and I/O orderings.
* An `AMO` for fetch-and-`XOR` (`AMOXOR`) has been added, and the encoding for
`AMOSWAP` has been changed to make room.
* The `AUIPC` instruction, which adds a 20-bit upper immediate to the `PC`,
replaces the `RDNPC` instruction, which only read the current `PC` value.
This results in significant savings for position-independent code.
* The `JAL` instruction has now moved to the `U-Type` format with an
explicit destination register, and the `J` instruction has been dropped
being replaced by `JAL` with _rd_=`x0`. This removes the only instruction
with an implicit destination register and removes the `J-Type` instruction
format from the base ISA. There is an accompanying reduction in `JAL`
reach, but a significant reduction in base ISA complexity.
* The static hints on the `JALR` instruction have been dropped. The hints
are redundant with the _rd_ and _rs1_ register specifiers for code
compliant with the standard calling convention.
* The `JALR` instruction now clears the lowest bit of the calculated
target address, to simplify hardware and to allow auxiliary information
to be stored in function pointers.
* The `MFTX.S` and `MFTX.D` instructions have been renamed to `FMV.X.S` and
`FMV.X.D`, respectively. Similarly, `MXTF.S` and `MXTF.D` instructions have
been renamed to `FMV.S.X` and `FMV.D.X`, respectively.
* The `MFFSR` and `MTFSR` instructions have been renamed to `FRCSR` and `FSCSR`,
respectively. `FRRM`, `FSRM`, `FRFLAGS`, and `FSFLAGS` instructions have been
added to individually access the rounding mode and exception flags
subfields of the `fcsr`.
* The `FMV.X.S` and `FMV.X.D` instructions now source their operands from
_rs1_, instead of _rs2_. This change simplifies datapath design.
* `FCLASS.S` and `FCLASS.D` floating-point classify instructions have been
added.
* A simpler NaN generation and propagation scheme has been adopted.
* For `RV32I`, the system performance counters have been extended to
64-bits wide, with separate read access to the upper and lower 32 bits.
* Canonical `NOP` and `MV` encodings have been defined.
* Standard instruction-length encodings have been defined for 48-bit,
64-bit, and latexmath:[$>$]64-bit instructions.
* Description of a 128-bit address space variant, `RV128`, has been added.
* Major opcodes in the 32-bit base instruction format have been
allocated for user-defined custom extensions.
* A typographical error that suggested that stores source their data
from _rd_ has been corrected to refer to _rs2_.
