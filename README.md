- Volume II: Privileged Architecture

## Official and Draft Versions

- **Official versions** of the specifications are available at the [RISC-V International website](https://riscv.org/specifications/).
- **Compiled versions of the most recent drafts** of the specifications can be found on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/latest).
- **Older official versions** of the specifications are archived at the [GitHub releases archive](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/archive).

The canonical list of **open-source RISC-V implementations' marchid CSR values** is available in the [marchid.md file](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/main/marchid.md).

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this documentation, please refer to the [Documentation Developer's Guide](https://github.com/riscv/docs-dev-guide).

The recommended method for building the PDF files is to use the Docker Image, as described in the [RISC-V Docs Base Container Image repository](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-docs-base-container-image).

Alternative build methods, such as local builds and GitHub Action builds, are also available and described in the Documentation Developer's Guide.

## Images not rendered for EPUB files

If the eBook reader does not support embedded images, uncomment `:data-uri:` lines in `src/riscv-privileged.adoc` and `src/riscv-unprivileged.adoc`.

### Known devices that cannot handle embedded images

- PocketBook InkPad 3
